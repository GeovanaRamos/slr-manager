Abstract = {Background: Conversational agents (CAs), also known as chatbots, are
   computer programs that simulate human conversations by using
   predetermined rule-based responses or artificial intelligence
   algorithms. They are increasingly used in health care, particularly via
   smartphones. There is, at present, no conceptual framework guiding the
   development of smartphone-based, rule-based CAs in health care. To fill
   this gap, we propose structured and tailored guidance for their design,
   development, evaluation, and implementation. Objective: The aim of this
   study was to develop a conceptual framework for the design, evaluation,
   and implementation of smartphone-delivered, rule-based, goal-oriented,
   and text-based CAs for health care. Methods: We followed the approach by
   Jabareen, which was based on the grounded theory method, to develop this
   conceptual framework. We performed 2 literature reviews focusing on
   health care CAs and conceptual frameworks for the development of mobile
   health interventions. We identified, named, categorized, integrated, and
   synthesized the information retrieved from the literature reviews to
   develop the conceptual framework. We then applied this framework by
   developing a CA and testing it in a feasibility study. Results: The
   Designing, Developing, Evaluating, and Implementing a
   Smartphone-Delivered, Rule-Based Conversational Agent (DISCOVER)
   conceptual framework includes 8 iterative steps grouped into 3 stages,
   as follows: design, comprising defining the goal, creating an identity,
   assembling the team, and selecting the delivery interface; development,
   including developing the content and building the conversation flow; and
   the evaluation and implementation of the CA. They were complemented by 2
   cross-cuttingconsiderations-user-centered design and privacy and
   security-that were relevant at all stages. This conceptual framework was
   successfully applied in the development of a CA to support lifestyle
   changes and prevent type 2 diabetes. Conclusions: Drawing on published
   evidence, the DISCOVER conceptual framework provides a step-by-step
   guide for developing rule-based, smartphone-delivered CAs. Further
   evaluation of this framework in diverse health care areas and settings
   and for a variety of users is needed to demonstrate its validity. Future
   research should aim to explore the use of CAs to deliver health care
   interventions, including behavior change and potential privacy and
   safety concerns.},

Abstract = {Children's privacy concerns about smart toys are becoming more and more
   critical in the toy industry. Parents and guardians continue to strive
   to protect their children from unnecessary privacy risks such as
   collection, and unconsented use of or access to their children's
   information. However, there is still no standardized privacy framework,
   which focuses on smart toys in this paradigm; making it difficult to
   determine possible privacy violation in for example determining whether
   a phrase shared with a smart toy is sensitive or not. To overcome this
   challenge, we build a privacy identification system through Chatbot
   technology. We call this system a Children Privacy Identification (CPI)
   system. To develop CPI system, we divide our research works into two
   parts: (1) Collect the phrase from the smart toys; and (2) Explore
   privacy Identification based on Personally Identifiable Information
   (PII) and Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). For
   illustration, we integrate the CPI system in LINE Chatbot. The result
   shows that people feel more comfortable in talking to LINE Chatbot with
   privacy protection.},

Abstract = {Privacy is one of the key issues for citizen's everyday online
   activities, with the United Nations defining it as ``a human right in
   the digital age{''}. Despite the introduction of data privacy
   regulations almost everywhere around the globe, the biggest barrier to
   effectiveness is the customer's capacity to map the privacy statement
   received with the regulation in force and understand their terms. This
   study advocates the creation of a convenient and cost-efficient
   question-answering service for answering customers' queries on data
   privacy. It proposes a dual step approach, allowing consumers to ask
   support to a conversational agent boosted by a smart knowledge base,
   attempting to answer the question using the most appropriate legal
   document. Being the self-help approach insufficient, our system enacts a
   second step suggesting a ranked list of legal experts for focused
   advice. To achieve our objective, we need large enough and specialised
   dataset and we plan to apply state-of-the-art Natural Language
   Processing (NLP) techniques in the field of open domain question
   answering. This paper describes the initial steps and some early results
   we achieved in this direction and the next steps we propose to develop a
   one-stop solution for consumers privacy needs.},

   the privacy risks of chatbots. In this paper, we propose two
   privacy-preserving approaches for chatbot conversations. The first
   approach applies `entity' based privacy filtering and transformation,
   and can be applied directly on the app (client) side. It however
   requires knowledge of the chatbot design to be enabled. We present a
   second scheme based on Searchable Encryption that is able to preserve
   user chat privacy, without requiring any knowledge of the chatbot
   design. Finally, we present some experimental results based on a
   real-life employee Help Desk chatbot that validates both the need and
   feasibility of the proposed approaches.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to examine the antecedents of privacy concerns
   in the era of artificial intelligence. Specifically, it focuses on the
   impact of various factors related to interactions with a chatbot
   (creepiness and perceived risk) and individual traits (familiarity with
   chatbots and need for privacy) in relation to privacy when interacting
   with a chatbot in the context of financial services. The moderating
   effect of gender on these relationships was also examined.
   Design/methodology/approach A total of 430 Canadians responded to an
   online questionnaire after interacting with a chatbot in the context of
   a simulated auto insurance quote. A structural equation model was used
   to test the hypotheses. Findings The results showed that privacy
   concerns are influenced primarily by creepiness, followed by perceived
   risk and the need for privacy. The last two relationships are moderated
   by gender. Conversely, familiarity with chatbots does not affect privacy
   concerns in this context. Originality/value This study is the first to
   consider the influence of creepiness as an antecedent of privacy
   concerns arising from interactions with AI tools and highlight its key
   impacts. It also shows how gender moderates specific relationships in
   this context.},

Abstract = {The rise of AI has prompted the financial business to enter the
   intelligent financial technology (FinTech). Chatbot with AI technologies
   is an important member of FinTech. The financial industry is actively
   introducing chatbot to enhance the market competitive advantage. Many
   banks and card issuers in the United States have introduced or developed
   chatbots from 2017 to increase user convenience and assist business
   promotion of financial institutions. However, chatbot with AI features
   may infringe customer security and personal privacy. Security has become
   an important issue that Chatbot must pay attention to. In order to
   improve the security of chatbot, this paper analyzes the security
   strategies of e-commerce (EC), and combines the AI security principles
   to plan the Chatbot Security Control Procedure (CSCP). CSCP uses
   security specifications confirmation, specifications implementation,
   inspection activity and improvement manners four stages to monitor
   chatbot. Banking chatbot with CSPS can hold advantages of chatbots,
   reduce the security risk, and concretely protect customer data security
   and personal privacy.},

Abstract = {Difference in features of voice such as tone, volume, intonation, and
   rate of speech have been suggested as sensitive and valid measures of
   mental illness. Researchers have used analysis of voice recordings
   during phone calls, response to the IVR systems and smartphone based
   conversational agents as a marker in continuous monitoring of symptoms
   and effect of treatment in patients with mental illness. While these
   methods of recording the patient's voice have been considered efficient,
   they come with a number of issues in terms of adoption, privacy,
   security, data storage etc. To address these issues we propose a smart
   speaker based conversational agent - ``Hear me out{''}. In this paper,
   we describe the proposed system, rationale behind using smart speakers,
   and the challenges we are facing in the design of the system.},

Abstract = {Chatbots are artificial communication systems becoming increasingly
   popular and not all their security questions are clearly solved. People
   use chatbots for assistance in shopping, bank communication, meal
   delivery, healthcare, cars, and many other actions. However, it brings
   an additional security risk and creates serious security challenges
   which have to be handled. Understanding the underlying problems requires
   defining the crucial steps in the techniques used to design chatbots
   related to security. There are many factors increasing security threats
   and vulnerabilities. All of them are comprehensively studied, and
   security practices to decrease security weaknesses are presented. Modern
   chatbots are no longer rule-based models, but they employ modern natural
   language and machine learning techniques. Such techniques learn from a
   conversation, which can contain personal information. The paper
   discusses circumstances under which such data can be used and how
   chatbots treat them. Many chatbots operate on a social/messaging
   platform, which has their terms and conditions about data. The paper
   aims to present a comprehensive study of security aspects in
   communication with chatbots. The article could open a discussion and
   highlight the problems of data storage and usage obtained from the
   communication user-chatbot and propose some standards to protect the
   user.},

Abstract = {The present research focuses on the interplay between two common
   features of the customer service chatbot experience: gaze direction and
   anthropomorphism. Although the dominant approach in marketing theory and
   practice is to make chatbots as human-like as possible, the current
   study, built on the humanness-value-loyalty model, addresses the chain
   of effects through which chatbots' nonverbal behaviors affect customers'
   willingness to disclose personal information and purchase intentions. By
   means of two experiments that adopt a real chatbot in a simulated
   shopping environment (i.e., car rental and travel insurance), the
   present work allows us to understand how to reduce individuals' tendency
   to see conversational agents as less knowledgeable and empathetic
   compared with humans. The results show that warmth perceptions are
   affected by gaze direction, whereas competence perceptions are affected
   by anthropomorphism. Warmth and competence perceptions are found to be
   key drivers of consumers' skepticism toward the chatbot, which, in turn,
   affects consumers' trust toward the service provider hosting the
   chatbot, ultimately leading consumers to be more willing to disclose
   their personal information and to repatronize the e-tailer in the
   future. Building on the Theory of Mind, our results show that perceiving
   competence from a chatbot makes individuals less skeptical as long as
   they feel they are good at detecting others' ultimate intentions.},

Title = {EREBOTS: Privacy-Compliant Agent-Based Platform for Multi-Scenario
   Personalized Health-Assistant Chatbots},

Abstract = {Context. Asynchronous messaging is increasingly used to support
   human-machine interactions, generally implemented through chatbots. Such
   virtual entities assist the users in activities of different kinds
   (e.g., work, leisure, and health-related) and are becoming ingrained
   into humans' habits due to factors including (i) the availability of
   mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, (ii) the increasingly
   engaging nature of chatbot interactions, (iii) the release of dedicated
   APIs from messaging platforms, and (iv) increasingly complex AI-based
   mechanisms to power the bots' behaviors. Nevertheless, most of the
   modern chatbots rely on state machines (implementing conversational
   rules) and one-fits-all approaches, neglecting personalization,
   data-stream privacy management, multi-topic management/interconnection,
   and multimodal interactions. Objective. This work addresses the
   challenges above through an agent-based framework for chatbot
   development named EREBOTS. Methods. The foundations of the framework are
   based on the implementation of (i) multi-front-end connectors and
   interfaces (i.e., Telegram, dedicated App, and web interface), (ii)
   enabling the configuration of multi-scenario behaviors (i.e., preventive
   physical conditioning, smoking cessation, and support for breast-cancer
   survivors), (iii) online learning, (iv) personalized conversations and
   recommendations (i.e., mood boost, anti-craving persuasion, and
   balance-preserving physical exercises), and (v) responsive multi-device
   monitoring interface (i.e., doctor and admin). Results. EREBOTS has been
   tested in the context of physical balance preservation in social
   confinement times (due to the ongoing pandemic). Thirteen individuals
   characterized by diverse age, gender, and country distribution have
   actively participated in the experimentation, reporting advancements in
   the physical balance and overall satisfaction of the interaction and
   exercises' variety they have been proposed.},

Title = {Trust and digital privacy: willingness to disclose personal information

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {This study explored digital privacy concerns in the use of chatbots as a
   digital banking service. Three dimensions of trust were tested in
   relation to user self-disclosure in order to better understand the
   consumer-chatbot experience in banking. The methodology selected for
   this research study followed a conclusive, pre-experimental, two-group
   one-shot case study research design which made use of a non-probability
   snowballing sampling technique. Privacy concerns were found to have a
   significantly negative relationship with user self-disclosure in both
   treatment groups. Respondents exposed to their preferred banking brand
   experienced lower user self-disclosure and brand trust than those
   exposed to a fictitious banking brand within the South African context.
   It is recommended that companies using chatbots focus on easing privacy
   concerns and build foundations of trust. The gains that chatbots have
   made in the form of increased productivity and quality of customer
   service rely on relationships with users who need to disclose personal
   information. Through this study, we concluded that, despite its power to
   influence decision-making, the power of a brand is not enough for
   consumers to considerably increase self-disclosure. Rather, a bridge of
   trust (through education, communication and product development) is
   needed that encompasses all three elements of trust, which are brand
   trust, cognitive trust and emotional trust. Limited research exists on
   the relationship between financial services marketing and chatbot
   adoption. Thus, this study addressed a theoretical gap, by adding brand
   trust to existing studies on cognitive and emotional trust regarding
   user self-disclosure.},

Journal = {ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The application of artificial intelligence is considered essential to
   adapt to a new cycle of industrial trans-formation and technological
   advancements in many fields and industries. The extensive use of
   artificial intel-ligence technology is expected to improve the level and
   quality of services provided by companies adopting these methods. In
   this study, we propose a novel approach to self-recovery by chatbot
   systems after service failures based on social response theory.
   Moreover, we explore differences in consumer perceptions of different
   service recovery types and their impact on recovery satisfaction, and
   discusses whether the intelligence of the compu-tational agent also has
   an effect. We present the results of three scenario-based experiments,
   which demonstrate the positive effect of chatbot self-recovery on
   consumer satisfaction, and show the mediating paths of service recovery
   types in terms of perceived functional value and privacy risks as well
   as the boundary condition of the level of robot intelligence. This work
   expands the range of applications of chatbots in the service industry
   and provides a new framework for the governance of artificial

Abstract = {Purpose Chatbot technology is expected to revolutionize customer service
   in financial institutions. However, the adoption of customer service
   chatbots in banking remains low. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to
   identify relevant segments of potential banking chatbot users based on
   technology adoption behavior.
   Design/Methodology/Approach - Data for the research was collected
   through an online questionnaire in Romania using the non-probability
   sampling method. The 287 questionnaires were analyzed using hierarchical
   and k-means cluster analysis.
   Findings and implications - The analysis revealed three distinct
   segments: Innovators (2696), consisting of highly educated young women
   employed in the business sector; the Late Majority (55\%), consisting of
   young women with higher education degrees who work in services-related
   fields; and Laggards (19\%), consisting of educated middle-aged men
   employed in the business sector. New significant differences among
   demographic: and banking behavior variables weft observed across the
   profiles of potential banking chatbot user segments.
   Limitations - The study is based on a non-probability sample collected
   from only one country, with a rather small sample size.
   Originality -Technology acceptance variables (perceived usefulness,
   perceived ease of use), expanded to include constructs such as awareness
   of service, perceived privacy risk, and perceived compatibility, were
   found to be appro priate for customer segmentation purposes in the
   context of chatbot applications based on artificial intelligence. The
   study also revealed a new innovator demographic profile.},

Abstract = {Chatbots are increasingly becoming important gateways to digital
   services and information-taken up within domains such as customer
   service, health, education, and work support. However, there is only
   limited knowledge concerning the impact of chatbots at the individual,
   group, and societal level. Furthermore, a number of challenges remain to
   be resolved before the potential of chatbots can be fully realized. In
   response, chatbots have emerged as a substantial research area in recent
   years. To help advance knowledge in this emerging research area, we
   propose a research agenda in the form of future directions and
   challenges to be addressed by chatbot research. This proposal
   consolidates years of discussions at the CONVERSATIONS workshop series
   on chatbot research. Following a deliberative research analysis process
   among the workshop participants, we explore future directions within six
   topics of interest: (a) users and implications, (b) user experience and
   design, (c) frameworks and platforms, (d) chatbots for collaboration,
   (e) democratizing chatbots, and (f) ethics and privacy. For each of
   these topics, we provide a brief overview of the state of the art,
   discuss key research challenges, and suggest promising directions for
   future research. The six topics are detailed with a 5-year perspective
   in mind and are to be considered items of an interdisciplinary research
   agenda produced collaboratively by avid researchers in the field.},

Abstract = {AI technology is being introduced into various public and private
   service domains, transforming existing computing systems or creating new
   ones. While AI technologies can provide benefits to humans and society,
   the unexpected consequences (e.g., malfunctions) of AI systems can cause
   social losses. For this reason, research on ethical design for the
   development of AI-based systems is becoming important. In this paper,
   from existing studies on AI ethics, general guidelines such as
   transparency, explainability, predictability, accountability, fairness,
   privacy, and control for the ethical design of AI systems are reviewed.
   And, based on the ethical design guidelines, we discuss ethical design
   to reduce the negative effects of biased data and unethical dialogues in
   AI-based conversational chatbots.},

Title = {Chatbot for construction firms using scalable blockchain network},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {141},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), including multimedia
   tools, email services, voice-based tools, and handheld computing tools,
   have been extensively used for automating and digitalizing different
   construction processes and activities. However, these technologies are
   subjected to single-point attacks or failures, manipulation, and lack of
   privacy and traceability. This study introduces a novel information
   exchange and management system for construction firms based on
   blockchain technology and chatbots. The system leverages the
   characteristics of blockchain technology in terms of peer-to-peer
   operation mode, data integrity, structuring, and privacy, and the
   chatbots' merits regarding ease of use and degree of automation. The
   system is developed for tracking work progress in construction projects
   as a generic use-case using a four-step approach. First, a private
   blockchain network is configured for data distribution and storage.
   Second, a smart contract is coded for regulating data writing/reading
   operations. Third, a chatbot is developed for data collection and
   retrieval through textual conversations. Fourth, serverless cloud
   function and cloudant database are configured to allow the linkage
   between the blockchain network and the chatbot. A prototype of the
   system is built and applied to a case study of non-residential
   construction project to test and verify its capabilities. Further, the
   system's performance is assessed in terms of the writing and reading
   latencies and the storage size. The system features can be extended by
   embedding mathematical algorithms to simultaneously analyze data and
   employing Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) to maintain visuals and
   large-size data.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   Recognising the high numbers of unbanked and financially excluded adults
   in Nigeria, this study aims to position chatbot as a digital
   transformation tool to radically change business model, improve customer
   experience and enhance financial inclusion in emerging markets.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The Search-Access-Test (S-A-T) model was adopted to understand how
   Nigerian banks are adopting chatbots.
   Findings
   A majority of Nigerian banks now have chatbots that enhance customer
   engagement and financial inclusion. WhatsApp was the most frequently
   used platform. Chatbots were often branded and presented with female
   gender identification. The chatbots were less responsive beyond their
   predefined path. While Nigeria is a multilingual country with English
   being the original language, none of the chatbots used any of the
   Nigerian's local languages.
   Practical implications
   Brands need to re-evaluate their chatbots with regard to responsiveness,
   predefined questions, verification and privacy. There are also
   possibilities of branding the chatbot and developing content creation
   strategies for proper engagement. Beyond English, the integration of
   African languages into chatbot is essential for digital transformation.
   Digital literacy and skills, particularly in the field of science,
   technology, engineering and mathematics, should be supported to equip
   future developers and create more jobs.
   Originality/value
   While many theoretically based models for investigating the adoption of
   digital technologies have often placed focus on users' ability to
   engage, this study takes an alternative perspective; by using the S-A-T
   model, it lays the responsibilities on the banks and chatbot developer
   to ensure that their chatbots are secure, responsive and able to meet
   the needs of the customers.},

Title = {A Medical Ethics Framework for Conversational Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Month = {JUL 26},
Abstract = {The launch of OpenAI's GPT-3 model in June 2020 began a new era for
   conversational chatbots. While there are chatbots that do not use
   artificial intelligence (AI), conversational chatbots integrate AI
   language models that allow for back-and-forth conversation between an AI
   system and a human user. GPT-3, since upgraded to GPT-4, harnesses a
   natural language processing technique called sentence embedding and
   allows for conversations with users that are more nuanced and realistic
   than before. The launch of this model came in the first few months of
   the COVID-19 pandemic, where increases in health care needs globally
   combined with social distancing measures made virtual medicine more
   relevant than ever. GPT-3 and other conversational models have been used
   for a wide variety of medical purposes, from providing basic
   COVID-19-related guidelines to personalized medical advice and even
   prescriptions. The line between medical professionals and conversational
   chatbots is somewhat blurred, notably in hard-to-reach communities where
   the chatbot replaced face-to-face health care. Considering these blurred
   lines and the circumstances accelerating the adoption of conversational
   chatbots globally, we analyze the use of these tools from an ethical
   perspective. Notably, we map out the many types of risks in the use of
   conversational chatbots in medicine to the principles of medical ethics.
   In doing so, we propose a framework for better understanding the effects
   of these chatbots on both patients and the medical field more broadly,
   with the hope of informing safe and appropriate future developments.},

Title = {Thematic Analysis on User Reviews for Depression and Anxiety Chatbot
   Apps: Machine Learning Approach},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Anxiety and depression are among the most commonly prevalent
   mental health disorders worldwide. Chatbot apps can play an important
   role in relieving anxiety and depression. Users' reviews of chatbot apps
   are considered an important source of data for exploring users' opinions
   and satisfaction.
   Objective: This study aims to explore users' opinions, satisfaction, and
   attitudes toward anxiety and depression chatbot apps by conducting a
   thematic analysis of users' reviews of 11 anxiety and depression chatbot
   apps collected from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. In
   addition, we propose a workflow to provide a methodological approach for
   future analysis of app review comments.
   Methods: We analyzed 205,581 user review comments from chatbots designed
   for users with anxiety and depression symptoms. Using scraper tools and
   Google Play Scraper and App Store Scraper Python libraries, we extracted
   the text and metadata. The reviews were divided into positive and
   negative meta-themes based on users' rating per review. We analyzed the
   reviews using word frequencies of bigrams and words in pairs. A topic
   modeling technique, latent Dirichlet allocation, was applied to identify
   topics in the reviews and analyzed to detect themes and subthemes.
   Results: Thematic analysis was conducted on 5 topics for each
   sentimental set. Reviews were categorized as positive or negative. For
   positive reviews, the main themes were confidence and affirmation
   building, adequate analysis, and consultation, caring as a friend, and
   ease of use. For negative reviews, the results revealed the following
   themes: usability issues, update issues, privacy, and noncreative
   conversations.
   Conclusions: Using a machine learning approach, we were able to analyze
   >= 200,000 comments and categorize them into themes, allowing us to

   Sharing},
Journal = {FUTURE INTERNET},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Thanks to the popularity of personal mobile devices, more and more of
   the different types of private content, such as images and videos, are
   shared on social networking applications. While content sharing may be
   an effective practice to enhance social relationships, it is also a
   source of relevant privacy issues. Unfortunately, users find it
   difficult to understanding the terms and implications of the privacy
   policies of apps and services. Moreover, taking privacy decisions about
   content sharing on social networks is cumbersome and prone to errors
   that could determine privacy leaks. In this paper, we propose two
   techniques aimed at supporting the user in taking privacy choices about
   sharing personal content online. Our techniques are based on machine
   learning and natural language processing to analyze privacy policies,
   and on computer vision to assist the user in the privacy-conscious
   sharing of multimedia content. Experiments with real-world data show the
   potential of our solutions. We also present ongoing work on a system
   prototype and chatbot for natural language user assistance.},

Abstract = {The temptation to be able to talk to a machine is not new. Recent
   advancements in the field of Natural Language Understanding has made it
   possible to build conversational components that can be plugged inside
   an application, similar to other components. These components, called
   chatbots, can be created from scratch or with the help of commercially
   available platforms. These platforms make it easier to build and deploy
   chatbots, often without writing a single line of code. However, similar
   to any other software component, chatbots also have quality concerns.
   Despite significant contributions in the field, an architectural
   perspective of building chatbots with desired quality requirements is
   missing in the literature.
   In the current work, we highlight the impact of features provided by
   these platforms (along with their quality) on the application design
   process and overall quality attributes. We propose a methodological
   framework to evaluate support provided by a chatbot platform towards
   achieving quality in the application. The framework, called Hospitality
   Framework, is based on software architectural body of knowledge,
   especially architectural tactics. The framework produces a metric,
   called Hospitality Index, which has utilities for making various design
   decisions for the overall application. We present the use of our
   framework on a simple use case to highlight the phases of evaluation. We
   showcase the process by picking three popular chatbot platforms - Watson
   Assistant, DialogFlow and Lex, over four quality attributes -
   Modifiability, Security \& Privacy, Interoperability and Reliability.
   Our results show that different platforms provide different support for
   these four quality attributes.},

Journal = {KYBERNETES},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 APR 28},
Abstract = {Purpose By extending the service robot acceptance model (sRAM), this
   study aims to explore and enhance the acceptance of chatbots. The study
   considered functional, relational, social, user and gratification
   elements in determining the acceptance of chatbots.
   Design/methodology/approach By using the purposive sampling technique,
   data of 321 service customers, gathered from millennials through a
   questionnaire and subsequent PLS-SEM modeling, was applied for
   hypotheses testing. Findings Findings revealed that the functional
   elements, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use affect
   acceptance of chatbots. However, in social elements, only perceived
   social interactivity affects the acceptance of chatbots. Moreover, both
   user and gratification elements (hedonic motivation and symbolic
   motivation) significantly influence the acceptance of chatbots. Lastly,
   trust is the only contributing factor for the acceptance of chatbots in
   the relational elements. Practical implications The study extends the
   literature related to chatbots and offers several guidelines to the
   service industry to effectively employ chatbots. Originality/value This
   is one of the first studies that used newly developed sRAM in
   determining chatbot acceptance. Moreover, the study extended the sRAM by
   adding user and gratification elements and privacy concerns as
   originally sRAM model was limited to functional, relational and social
   elements.},

Title = {Conversational Physical Activity Coaches for Spanish and English
   Speaking Women: A User Design Study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {OCT 8},
Abstract = {Introduction: Digital technologies, including text messaging and mobile
   phone apps, can be leveraged to increase people's physical activity and
   manage health. Chatbots, powered by artificial intelligence, can
   automatically interact with individuals through natural conversation.
   They may be more engaging than one-way messaging interventions. To our
   knowledge, physical activity chatbots have not been developed with
   low-income participants, nor in Spanish-the second most dominant
   language in the U.S. We recommend best practices for physical activity
   chatbots in English and Spanish for low-income women.Methods: We
   designed a prototype physical activity text-message based conversational
   agent based on various psychotherapeutic techniques. We recruited
   participants through SNAP-Ed (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
   Education) in California (Alameda County) and Tennessee (Shelby County).
   We conducted qualitative interviews with participants during testing of
   our prototype chatbot, held a Wizard of Oz study, and facilitated a
   co-design workshop in Spanish with a subset of our participants.Results:
   We included 10 Spanish- and 8 English-speaking women between 27 and 41
   years old. The majority was Hispanic/Latina (n = 14), 2 were White and 2
   were Black/African American. More than half were monolingual Spanish
   speakers, and the majority was born outside the US (>50\% in Mexico).
   Most participants were unfamiliar with chatbots and were initially
   skeptical. After testing our prototype, most users felt positively about
   health chatbots. They desired a personalized chatbot that addresses
   their concerns about privacy, and stressed the need for a comprehensive
   system to also aid with nutrition, health information, stress, and
   involve family members. Differences between English and monolingual
   Spanish speakers were found mostly in exercise app use, digital
   literacy, and the wish for family inclusion.Conclusion: Low-income
   Spanish- and English-speaking women are interested in using chatbots to
   improve their physical activity and other health related aspects.
   Researchers developing health chatbots for this population should focus
   on issues of digital literacy, app familiarity, linguistic and cultural
   issues, privacy concerns, and personalization. Designing and testing
   this intervention for and with this group using co-creation techniques
   and involving community partners will increase the probability that it
   will ultimately be effective.},

Abstract = {Conversational interfaces have risen in popularity as businesses and
   users adopt a range of conversational agents, including chatbots and
   voice assistants. Although guidelines have been proposed, there is not
   yet an established set of usability heuristics to guide and evaluate
   conversational agent design. In this paper, we propose a set of
   heuristics for conversational agents adapted from Nielsen's heuristics
   and based on expert feedback. We then validate the heuristics through
   two rounds of evaluations conducted by participants on two
   conversational agents, one chatbot and one voice-based personal
   assistant. We find that, when using our heuristics to evaluate both
   interfaces, evaluators were able to identify more usability issues than
   when using Nielsen's heuristics. We propose that our heuristics
   successfully identify issues related to dialogue content, interaction
   design, help and guidance, human-like characteristics, and data privacy.},

Title = {Utilization of Self-Diagnosis Health Chatbots in Real-World Settings:
   Case Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 6},
Abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven chatbots are
   increasingly being used in health care, but most chatbots are designed
   for a specific population and evaluated in controlled settings. There is
   little research documenting how health consumers (eg, patients and
   caregivers) use chatbots for self-diagnosis purposes in real-world
   scenarios.
   Objective: The aim of this research was to understand how health
   chatbots are used in a real-world context, what issues and barriers
   exist in their usage, and how the user experience of this novel
   technology can be improved.
   Methods: We employed a data-driven approach to analyze the system log of
   a widely deployed self-diagnosis chatbot in China. Our data set
   consisted of 47,684 consultation sessions initiated by 16,519 users over
   6 months. The log data included a variety of information, including
   users' nonidentifiable demographic information, consultation details,
   diagnostic reports, and user feedback. We conducted both statistical
   analysis and content analysis on this heterogeneous data set.
   Results: The chatbot users spanned all age groups, including middle-aged
   and older adults. Users consulted the chatbot on a wide range of medical
   conditions, including those that often entail considerable privacy and
   social stigma issues. Furthermore, we distilled 2 prominent issues in
   the use of the chatbot: (1) a considerable number of users dropped out
   in the middle of their consultation sessions, and (2) some users
   pretended to have health concerns and used the chatbot for
   nontherapeutic purposes. Finally, we identified a set of user concerns
   regarding the use of the chatbot, including insufficient actionable
   information and perceived inaccurate diagnostic suggestions.
   Conclusions: Although health chatbots are considered to be convenient
   tools for enhancing patient-centered care, there are issues and barriers
   impeding the optimal use of this novel technology. Designers and
   developers should employ user-centered approaches to address the issues
   and user concerns to achieve the best uptake and utilization. We
   conclude the paper by discussing several design implications, including
   making the chatbots more informative, easy-to-use, and trustworthy, as
   well as improving the onboarding experience to enhance user engagement.},

Title = {How AI chatbots have reshaped the frontline interface in China:
   examining the role of sales-service ambidexterity and the

Abstract = {Purpose This study serves two purposes: (1) to evaluate the effects of
   organizational ambidexterity by examining how the balanced and the
   combined sales-service configurations of chatbots differ in their
   abilities to enhance customer experience and patronage and (2) to apply
   information boundary theory to assess the contingent role that chatbot
   sales-service ambidexterity can play in adapting to customers'
   personalization-privacy paradox. Design/methodology/approach An online
   survey of artificial intelligence chatbots users was conducted, and a
   mixed-methods research design involving response surface analysis and
   polynomial regression was adopted to address the research aim. Findings
   The results of polynomial regressions on survey data from 507 online
   customers indicated that as the benefits of personalization decreased
   and the risk to privacy increased, the inherently negative (positive)
   effects of imbalanced (combined) chatbots' sales-service ambidexterity
   had an increasing (decreasing) influence on customer experience.
   Furthermore, customer experience fully mediated the association of
   chatbots' sales-service ambidexterity with customer patronage.
   Originality/value First, this study enriches the literature on frontline
   ambidexterity and extends it to the setting of human-machine
   interaction. Second, the study contributes to the literature on the
   personalization-privacy paradox by demonstrating the importance of
   frontline ambidexterity for adapting to customer concerns. Third, the
   study examines the conduit between artificial intelligence (AI)
   chatbots' ambidexterity and sales performance, thereby helping to
   reconcile the previously inconsistent evidence regarding this
   relationship.},

Abstract = {An enhanced understanding of the innovative use of artificial
   intelligence (AI) is essential for organizations to improve work design
   and daily business operations. This study's purpose is to offer insights
   into how AI can transform organizations' work practices through diving
   deeply into its innovative use in the context of a primary AI tool, a
   chatbot, and examining the antecedents of innovative use by
   conceptualizing employee trust as a multidimensional construct and
   exploring employees' perceived benefits. In particular, we have
   conceptualized employee trust in chatbots as a second-order construct,
   including three first-order variables: trust in functionality, trust in
   reliability, and trust in data protection. We collected data from 202
   employees. The results supported our conceptualization of trust in
   chatbots and showed that three dimensions of first-order trust beliefs
   have relatively the same level of importance. Further, both knowledge
   support and work-life balance enhance trust in chatbots, which in turn
   leads to innovative use of chatbots. Our study contributes to the
   existing literature by introducing the new conceptualization of trust in
   chatbots and examining its antecedents and outcomes. The results can
   provide important practical insights regarding how to support innovative
   use of chatbots as the new way we organize work.},

Title = {Smart Speakers: The Next Frontier in mHealth},
Journal = {JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The rapid dissemination and adoption of smart speakers has enabled
   substantial opportunities to improve human health. Just as the
   introduction of the mobile phone led to considerable health innovation,
   smart speaker computing systems carry several unique advantages that
   have the potential to catalyze new fields of health research,
   particularly in out-of-hospital environments. The recent rise and
   ubiquity of these smart computing systems holds significant potential
   for enhancing chronic disease management, enabling passive
   identification of unwitnessed medical emergencies, detecting subtle
   changes in human behavior and cognition, limiting isolation, and
   potentially allowing widespread, passive, remote monitoring of
   respiratory diseases that impact public health. There are 3 broad
   mechanisms for how a smart speaker can interact with a person to improve
   health. These include (1) as an intelligent conversational agent, (2) as
   a passive identifier of medically relevant diagnostic sounds, and (3) by
   active sensing using the device's internal hardware to measure
   physiologic parameters, such as with active sonar, radar, or computer
   vision. Each of these different modalities has specific clinical use
   cases, all of which need to be balanced against potential privacy
   concerns, equity concerns related to system access, and regulatory
   frameworks which have not yet been developed for this unique type of
   passive data collection.},

Abstract = {Early conversational agents (CAs) focused on dyadic human-AI interaction
   between humans and the CAs, followed by the increasing popularity of
   polyadic human-AI interaction, in which CAs are designed to mediate
   human-human interactions. CAs for polyadic interactions are unique
   because they encompass hybrid social interactions, i.e., human-CA,
   human-to-human, and human-to-group behaviors. However, research on
   polyadic CAs is scattered across diferent felds, making it challenging
   to identify, compare, and accumulate existing knowledge. To promote the
   future design of CA systems, we conducted a literature review of ACM
   publications and identifed a set of works that conducted UX (user
   experience) research. We qualitatively synthesized the efects of
   polyadic CAs into four aspects of human-human interactions, i.e.,
   communication, engagement, connection, and relationship maintenance.
   Through a mixed-method analysis of the selected polyadic and dyadic CA
   studies, we developed a suite of evaluation measurements on the efects.
   Our fndings show that designing with social boundaries, such as privacy,
   disclosure, and identifcation, is crucial for ethical polyadic CAs.
   Future research should also advance usability testing methods and
   trust-building guidelines for conversational AI.},

   a system to realize psychodrama using robots. The advantages of using
   robots include the ability to carry out a psychodrama alone and to
   provide privacy-friendly support. In the experiment, a scenario was
   created for medical staff and a robot psychodrama was performed. As a
   result, we showed that robots can be used for psychodrama and esteem
   support can be carried out by combination of robots and the chatbot.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence is transforming the way chatbots are created and
   used. The recent boom of artificial intelligence development is creating
   a whole new generation of intelligent approaches that enable a more
   efficient and effective design of chatbots. On the other hand, the
   increasing need and interest from the industry in artificial
   intelligence based solutions, is guaranteeing the necessary investment
   and applicational know-how that is pushing such solutions to a new
   dimension. Some relevant examples are e-commerce, health or education,
   which is the main focus of this work. This paper studies and analyses
   the impact that artificial intelligence models and solutions is having
   on the design and development of chatbots, when compared to the
   previously used approaches. Some of the most relevant current and future
   challenges in this domain are highlighted, which include language

Abstract = {There is a paradigm shift in web-based services towards conversational
   user interfaces. Companies increasingly offer conversational interfaces,
   or chatbots, to let their customers or employees interact with their
   services in a more flexible and mobile manner. Unfortunately, this new
   paradigm faces a major problem, namely toxic content in user inputs.
   Toxic content in user inputs to chatbots may cause privacy concerns, may
   be adversarial or malicious, and can cause the chatbot provider
   substantial economic, reputational, or legal harm. We address this
   problem with an interdisciplinary approach, drawing upon programming
   languages, cloud computing, and other disciplines to build protections
   for chatbots. Our solution, called BotShield, is non-intrusive in that
   it does not require changes to existing chatbots or underlying
   conversational platforms. This paper introduces novel security
   mechanisms, articulates their security guarantees, and illustrates them
   via case studies.},

Abstract = {Studio-based learning (SBL) is a pedagogy that encompasses collaborative
   active learning strategies focusing on creativity, peer learning, and
   problem-solving. The iterative design procedures and critique sessions
   are the primary learning practices of SBL, which relays to a need to
   have effective communication between instructors and students. Due to
   this, we designed a Telegram chatbot using the TextIt to facilitate some
   of the interactions that are common in SBL. In this preliminary study,
   students' acceptance of chatbot was investigated based on the Technology
   Acceptance Model (TAM) using a mix-method approach. Preliminary results
   indicated positive acceptance and intention to use chatbots due to ease
   of use, mobile accessibility, human-like communications, and privacy in
   communicating and providing feedback.},

Title = {Can chatbots satisfy me? A mixed-method comparative study of
   satisfaction with task-oriented chatbots in mainland China and Hong Kong},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {143},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Task-oriented chatbots are gradually being used across the globe. Most
   notably, while chatbots have for a long time penetrated users' daily
   lives in mainland China, Hong Kong is still struggling to improve and
   promote its chatbot services. To determine whether antecedents of
   satisfaction and usage intention differ based on different stages of
   chatbot adoption and development, we conduct a comparative study based
   on a research model that integrates the Delone and McLean Information
   System success model and privacy concerns. The model is developed and
   examined using a mixed-method approach. After conducting focus group
   interviews (N = 15) in both regions, online surveys were conducted in
   mainland China (N = 637) and Hong Kong (N = 647), respec-tively. Based
   on qualitative exploration, we identified critical factors of perceived
   quality and privacy concerns. The quantitative findings further
   illuminate the different roles of the antecedents in the two regions.
   The results show that usage intention can be positively influenced by
   satisfaction, and satisfaction can be increased by relevance,
   completeness, pleasure and assurance in both regions. However, response
   time and empathy are factors influencing satisfaction only in mainland
   China. Privacy concerns cannot influence satisfaction in both regions.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, the use of chatbots for educational purposes has
   gained considerable traction. A similar trend has been observed in
   social coding platforms, where automated agents support software
   developers with tasks such as performing code reviews. While
   incorporating code reviews and social coding platforms into software
   engineering education has been found to be beneficial, challenges such
   as steep learning curves and privacy considerations are barriers to
   their adoption. Furthermore, no study has addressed the role chatbots
   play in supporting code reviews as a pedagogical tool. To help address
   this gap, we developed an online learning application that simulates the
   code review features available on social coding platforms and allows
   instructors to interact with students using chatbot identities. We then
   embedded this application within a lesson on software engineering best
   practices and conducted a controlled in-class experiment. This
   experiment examined the effect that explaining content via chatbot
   identities had on three aspects: (i) students' perceived usability of
   the lesson, (ii) their engagement with the code review process, and
   (iii) their learning gains. While our findings show that it is feasible
   to simulate the code review process within an online learning platform
   and achieve good usability, our quantitative analysis did not yield
   significant differences across treatment conditions for any of the
   aspects considered. Nevertheless, our qualitative results suggest that
   students expect explicit feedback when performing this type of exercise
   and could thus benefit from automated replies provided by an interactive
   chatbot. We propose to build on our current findings to further explore
   this line of research in future work.},

Abstract = {The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is enhancing the services and applications
   in government organizations through the number of systems that generate
   a massive amount of data through Big Data technology. Recently, the
   Global Artificial Intelligent Summit 2020, Saudi Data and Artificial
   Intelligence Authority (SDAIA), NEOM have launched an Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) strategy that aligns with the Kingdom Vision 2030. AI
   opens a wide door for opportunities and new strategies that will narrow
   the gap in the skillset of individuals and promote research and
   innovation in the IT industry. Organizations lack advanced techniques to
   evaluate the performance of individuals and departments that supports
   improving the quality of service. The introduction of AI-based
   applications in the government and private sectors will facilitate
   decision-makers in tracking and optimizing the efficiency of departments
   and individuals. This research aims to develop an intelligent framework
   for government organizations to improve the quality of services rendered
   to customers and businesses. In addition, it highlights the importance
   of AI policies in archiving metadata. This paper presents a framework
   for an organization that contains Chatbot, Sentiment Analysis, and Key
   Performance Indicators to improve the services. A synthetic dataset is
   employed as a testbed to evaluate the performance of the framework. The
   outcome of this study shows that the proposed framework able to improve
   the performance of organizations. Using this proposed framework,
   organizations can build a mechanism for their workforce to retrieve
   meaningful information. Moreover, it provides significant features
   include efficient data extraction, data management, and AI-based
   security for effective document management.},

Title = {?So what if ChatGPT wrote it?? Multidisciplinary perspectives on
   opportunities, challenges and implications of generative conversational
   AI for research, practice and policy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {71},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Transformative artificially intelligent tools, such as ChatGPT, designed
   to generate sophisticated text indistin-guishable from that produced by
   a human, are applicable across a wide range of contexts. The technology
   presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges,
   and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for
   organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary
   insight into some of these, this article brings together 43
   contributions from experts in fields such as computer science,
   marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and
   tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors
   acknowledge ChatGPT's capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest
   that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality
   and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business
   activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also
   consider its limitations, dis-ruptions to practices, threats to privacy
   and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation.
   However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT's use should be restricted
   or legislated. Drawing on these con-tributions, the article identifies
   questions requiring further research across three thematic areas:
   knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of
   organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly
   research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills,
   resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining
   biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes;
   exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI
   implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative
   AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text
   produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues
   in using generative AI across different contexts.},

Abstract = {Internationally, evidence exists that physicians use instant messaging
   services for communication tasks in everyday clinical practice However,
   there are only few data on physicians in Germany in this regard.
   Therefore, at the initiation of our project ``DocTalk-Dialog meets
   Chatbot: Collaborative Learning and Teaching in the Process of Work{''},
   we conducted a stakeholder survey with an exploratory research approach.
   The aim was to gain initial insights into use of instant messaging
   software and attitudes towards data security and advantages and
   disadvantages before implementing a data-secure in-house messaging
   platform. N = 70 physicians at Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin
   completed an exploratory questionnaire with closed and open-ended
   questions. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics
   and qualitative data using thematic analysis. The use of messenger
   software was not widespread in the sample studied. Physicians most
   frequently used face-to-face contact for communication. On average, up
   to ten instant messages were exchanged per day, mainly among colleagues,
   to answer mutual questions, and to send pictures. With a high awareness
   of privacy-related restrictions among participating physicians,
   advantages such as fast and uncomplicated communication were also
   highlighted. An instant messenger solution that complies with the German
   data protection guidelines is needed and should be investigated in more
   detail.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},

Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {The uses and gratifications approach is used to examine chatbot
   acceptance in coworking spaces, identifying how coworkers perceive the
   technology and may use it to facilitate their tasks. To do so, potential
   influence factors shaping technology acceptance are explored, and a
   sample of 101 German coworkers is employed to confirm the framework
   drawing on a quantitative combination of partial least squares
   structural equation modeling and necessary condition analysis.
   Instrumental and non-instrumental gratifications, as well as social
   norm, influence chatbot acceptance in the form of sufficient and
   necessary conditions, and social norm appears to have a more substantial
   impact than hedonic factors in terms of sufficiency. However, social
   norm is not a necessary condition. A moderator analysis reveals that
   privacy concerns, age and gender do not affect individuals' intention to
   use a chatbot. Coworking space providers thus benefit from establishing
   a standard chatbot solution to leverage social norm, and the chosen
   solution needs to fulfill hedonic expectations in addition to being
   useful. Software vendors may also integrate dedicated interfaces to
   powerful solutions such as ChatGPT.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {212-229},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {More and more companies have implemented chatbots on their websites to
   provide support to their visitors on a 24/7 basis. The new customer
   wants to spend less and less time and therefore expects to reach a
   company anytime and anywhere, regardless of time, location, and channel.
   This study provides insight into the influence of chatbots on customer
   loyalty. System quality, service quality, and information quality are
   crucial dimensions that a chatbot must meet to give a good customer
   experience. To make a chatbot more personal, companies can alter the
   language style. Human-like chatbots lead to greater satisfaction and
   trust among customers, leading to greater adoption of the chatbot. The
   results of this study showed that a connection between chatbots and
   customer loyalty is very likely. Besides, some customers suffer from the
   privacy paradox because of personalization. Implications of this study
   are discussed.},

   functional use and relational use of AI voice assistants},
Journal = {NEW MEDIA \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUL 15},
Abstract = {This study integrates two lines of research: technologies as tools and
   technologies as social beings, under the theoretical framework of
   dynamic systems, to investigate the reciprocal dynamics between
   functional use and relational use of artificial intelligence (AI) voice
   assistants, and the mediating roles of self-disclosure and privacy
   concerns. A two-wave longitudinal survey was conducted among 354 AI
   voice assistant users across 2 months. Factor analysis results supported
   the conceptualization and operationalization of functional use and
   relational use of voice assistants. Results from the cross-lagged panel
   model confirmed that functional use and relational use reinforced
   themselves over time, respectively. Relational use increased subsequent
   functional use, and relational use reinforced itself through
   self-disclosure. Surprisingly, functional use did not increase
   subsequent relational use; instead, longitudinal mediation analysis
   showed that functional use reduced subsequent relational use due to the
   lack of self-disclosure. Furthermore, while self-disclosure increased
   subsequent privacy concerns, privacy concerns did not reduce subsequent
   self-disclosure.},

Title = {Formative Evaluation of the Acceptance of HIV Prevention Artificial
   Intelligence Chatbots By Men Who Have Sex With Men in Malaysia: Focus
   Group Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Mobile technologies are being increasingly developed to
   support the practice of medicine, nursing, and public health, including
   HIV testing and prevention. Chatbots using artificial intelligence (AI)
   are novel mobile health strategies that can promote HIV testing and
   prevention among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Malaysia, a
   hard-to-reach population at elevated risk of HIV, yet little is known
   about the features that are important to this key population.Objective:
   The aim of this study was to identify the barriers to and facilitators
   of Malaysian MSM's acceptance of an AI chatbot designed to assist in HIV
   testing and prevention in relation to its perceived benefits,
   limitations, and preferred features among potential users.Methods: We
   conducted 5 structured web-based focus group interviews with 31 MSM in
   Malaysia between July 2021 and September 2021. The interviews were first
   recorded, transcribed, coded, and thematically analyzed using NVivo
   (version 9; QSR International). Subsequently, the unified theory of
   acceptance and use of technology was used to guide data analysis to map
   emerging themes related to the barriers to and facilitators of chatbot
   acceptance onto its 4 domains: performance expectancy, effort
   expectancy, facilitating conditions, and social influence.Results:
   Multiple barriers and facilitators influencing MSM's acceptance of an AI
   chatbot were identified for each domain. Performance expectancy (ie, the
   perceived usefulness of the AI chatbot) was influenced by MSM's concerns
   about the AI chatbot's ability to deliver accurate information, its
   effectiveness in information dissemination and problem-solving, and its
   ability to provide emotional support and raise health awareness.
   Convenience, cost, and technical errors influenced the AI chatbot's
   effort expectancy (ie, the perceived ease of use). Efficient linkage to
   health care professionals and HIV self-testing was reported as a
   facilitating condition of MSM's receptiveness to using an AI chatbot to
   access HIV testing. Participants stated that social influence (ie,
   sociopolitical climate) factors influencing the acceptance of mobile
   technology that addressed HIV in Malaysia included privacy concerns,
   pervasive stigma against homosexuality, and the criminalization of
   same-sex sexual behaviors. Key design strategies that could enhance
   MSM's acceptance of an HIV prevention AI chatbot included an anonymous
   user setting; embedding the chatbot in MSM-friendly web-based platforms;
   and providing user-guiding questions and options related to HIV testing,
   prevention, and treatment.Conclusions: This study provides important
   insights into key features and potential implementation strategies
   central to designing an AI chatbot as a culturally sensitive digital
   health tool to prevent stigmatized health conditions in vulnerable and
   systematically marginalized populations. Such features not only are
   crucial to designing effective user-centered and culturally situated
   mobile health interventions for MSM in Malaysia but also illuminate the
   importance of incorporating social stigma considerations into health
   technology implementation strategies.},

Abstract = {This technical report describes the methods undertaken by a US-based
   Digital Health company (X2AI or X2 for short) to develop an ethical code
   for startup environments and other organizations delivering emotional
   artificial intelligence (AI) services, especially for mental health
   support. With a growing demand worldwide for scalable, affordable, and
   accessible health care solutions, the use of AI offers tremendous
   potential to improve emotional well-being. To realize this potential, it
   is imperative that AI service providers prioritize clear and consistent
   ethical guidelines that align with global considerations regarding user
   safety and privacy. This report offers a template for an ethical code
   that can be implemented by other emotional AI services and their
   affiliates. It includes practical guidelines for integrating support
   from clients, collaborators, and research partners. It also shows how
   existing ethical systems can inform the development of AI ethics.},

Abstract = {Can a chatbot enable us to change our conceptions, to be critically
   reflective? To what extent can interaction with a technologically
   ``minimal{''} medium such as a chatbot evoke emotional engagement in
   ways that can challenge us to act on the world? In this paper, we
   discuss the design of a provocative bot, a ``bot of conviction{''},
   aimed at triggering conversations on complex topics (e.g. death, wealth
   distribution, gender equality, privacy) and, ultimately, soliciting
   specific actions from the user it converses with. We instantiate our
   design with a use case in the cultural sector, specifically a Neolithic
   archaeological site that acts as a stage of conversation on such hard
   themes. Our larger contributions include an interaction framework for
   bots of conviction, insights gained from an iterative process of
   participatory design and evaluation, and a vision for bot interaction
   mechanisms that can apply to the HCI community more widely.},

Title = {To chat or bot to chat: Ethical issues with using chatbots in mental
   health},
Journal = {DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper presents a critical review of key ethical issues raised by
   the emergence of mental health chatbots. Chatbots use varying degrees of
   artificial intelligence and are increasingly deployed in many different
   domains including mental health. The technology may sometimes be
   beneficial, such as when it promotes access to mental health information
   and services. Yet, chatbots raise a variety of ethical concerns that are
   often magnified in people experiencing mental ill-health. These ethical
   challenges need to be appreciated and addressed throughout the
   technology pipeline. After identifying and examining four important
   ethical issues by means of a recognised ethical framework comprised of
   five key principles, the paper offers recommendations to guide chatbot
   designers, purveyers, researchers and mental health practitioners in the
   ethical creation and deployment of chatbots for mental health.},

Title = {Applying the Digital Health Social Justice Guide},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2022},

Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Introduction Digital health, the use of apps, text-messaging, and online
   interventions, can revolutionize healthcare and make care more
   equitable. Currently, digital health interventions are often not
   designed for those who could benefit most and may have unintended
   consequences. In this paper, we explain how privacy vulnerabilities and
   power imbalances, including racism and sexism, continue to influence
   health app design and research. We provide guidelines for researchers to
   design, report and evaluate digital health studies to maximize social
   justice in health.Methods From September 2020 to April 2021, we held
   five discussion and brainstorming sessions with researchers, students,
   and community partners to develop the guide and the key questions. We
   additionally conducted an informal literature review, invited experts to
   review our guide, and identified examples from our own digital health
   study and other studies.Results We identified five overarching topics
   with key questions and subquestions to guide researchers in designing or
   evaluating a digital health research study. The overarching topics are:
   1. Equitable distribution; 2. Equitable design; 3. Privacy and data
   return; 4. Stereotype and bias; 5. Structural racism.Conclusion We
   provide a guide with five key topics and questions for social justice
   digital health research. Encouraging researchers and practitioners to
   ask these questions will help to spark a transformation in digital
   health toward more equitable and ethical research. Future work needs to
   determine if the quality of studies can improve when researchers use
   this guide.},

Abstract = {With the fast-growing popularity of online social networks (OSN),
   maintaining the security of OSN ecosystems becomes essential for the
   public. Among all the security threats facing OSN, malicious social bots
   have become the most common and detrimental. These bot programs are
   often employed to violate users' privacy, distribute spam, and disturb
   the financial market, posing a compelling need for effective social bot
   detection solutions.
   Unlike traditional bot detection approaches that have strict
   requirements on data sources (e.g., private payload information, social
   relationships, or activity histories), this paper proposes a detection
   method called BotFlowMon that relies only on NetFlow data as input to
   identify OSN bot traffic, where every NetFlow record is a summary of a
   traffic flow on the Internet and contains no payload content. BotFlowMon
   introduces several new algorithms and techniques to help use machine
   learning to classify the social bot traffic from the real OSN user
   traffic, including aggregating NetFlow records to obtain transaction
   data, fusing transaction data to extract features and visualize flows,
   as well as subdividing transactions into basic actions. Our evaluation
   shows that with 535GB raw NetFlow records as input, BotFlowMon can
   efficiently classify the traffic from social bots, including chatbot,
   amplification bot, post bot, crawler bot, and hybrid bot, with
   92.33-93.61\% accuracy.},

Title = {Systematizing Audit in Algorithmic Recruitment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Business psychologists study and assess relevant individual differences,
   such as intelligence and personality, in the context of work. Such
   studies have informed the development of artificial intelligence systems
   (AI) designed to measure individual differences. This has been
   capitalized on by companies who have developed AI-driven recruitment
   solutions that include aggregation of appropriate candidates (Hiretual),
   interviewing through a chatbot (Paradox), video interview assessment
   (MyInterview), and CV-analysis (Textio), as well as estimation of
   psychometric characteristics through image-(Traitify) and game-based
   assessments (HireVue) and video interviews (Cammio). However, driven by
   concern that such high-impact technology must be used responsibly due to
   the potential for unfair hiring to result from the algorithms used by
   these tools, there is an active effort towards proving mechanisms of
   governance for such automation. In this article, we apply a systematic
   algorithm audit framework in the context of the ethically critical
   industry of algorithmic recruitment systems, exploring how audit
   assessments on AI-driven systems can be used to assure that such systems
   are being responsibly deployed in a fair and well-governed manner. We
   outline sources of risk for the use of algorithmic hiring tools, suggest
   the most appropriate opportunities for audits to take place, recommend
   ways to measure bias in algorithms, and discuss the transparency of
   algorithms.},

Title = {Designing Virtual Reality-Based Conversational Agents to Train
   Clinicians in Verbal De-escalation Skills: Exploratory Usability Study},
Journal = {JMIR SERIOUS GAMES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Violence and aggression are significant workplace challenges
   faced by clinicians worldwide. Traditional methods of training consist
   of ``on-the-job learning{''} and role-play simulations. Although both
   approaches can result in improved skill levels, they are not without
   limitation. Interactive simulations using virtual reality (VR) can
   complement traditional training processes as a cost-effective, engaging,
   easily accessible, and flexible training tool.
   Objective: In this exploratory study, we aimed to determine the
   feasibility of and barriers to verbal engagement with a virtual agent in
   the context of the Code Black VR application. Code Black VR is a new
   interactive VR-based verbal de-escalation trainer that we developed
   based on the Clinical Training Through VR Design Framework.
   Methods: In total, 28 participants with varying clinical expertise from
   4 local hospitals enrolled in the Western Sydney Local Health District
   Clinical Initiative Nurse program and Transition to Emergency Nursing
   Programs and participated in 1 of 5 workshops. They completed multiple
   playthroughs of the Code Black VR verbal de-escalation trainer
   application and verbally interacted with a virtual agent. We documented
   observations and poststudy reflection notes. After the playthroughs, the
   users completed the System Usability Scale and provided written comments
   on their experience. A thematic analysis was conducted on the results.
   Data were also obtained through the application itself, which also
   recorded the total interactions and successfully completed interactions.
   Results: The Code Black VR verbal de-escalation training application was
   well received. The findings reinforced the factors in the existing
   design framework and identified 3 new factors-motion sickness, perceived
   value, and privacy-to be considered for future application development.
   Conclusions: Verbal interaction with a virtual agent is feasible for
   training staff in verbal de-escalation skills. It is an effective medium
   to supplement clinician training in verbal de-escalation skills. We
   provide broader design considerations to guide further developments in
   this area.},

Abstract = {This research presents a comprehensive understanding of AI in the public
   sector based on a review of 78 studies. The literature review indicates
   that an AI-analytical model and AI-based automation system are mostly
   used at the organizational level whilst AI-recommender and chatbot
   applications are implemented within the citizens' services context. The
   results reveal that AI benefits such as cost reduction and
   decision-making improvements are accrued by governments. Further, the
   benefits of personalization and positive user experiences are directly
   useful to citizens. The review highlights that developing and adopting
   AI, presents two categories of challenges: AI obstacles at the
   organizational level, such as employees' resistance, lack of managerial,
   and financial support, and second - AI dilemmas linked to citizens such
   as AI ambiguity, bias, and privacy. Accordingly, this study provides
   recommendations for further research on AI within the government and the
   public sector.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to explore the advances in artificial
   intelligence (AI) chatbots as part of public services, mainly when
   applied to mental health in today's post-pandemic world. The adoption of
   AI chatbots to keep up with basic customer support business activities
   is based on extensive knowledge, both from the hard (software
   development) and the soft side (increasing the added value to the
   service/product). However, using chatbots as extenders of public
   services to support mental health in pandemic times is an emerging
   research topic. Hence, the paper identifies niche and under-explored
   research gaps in state-of-the-art literature, thus contributing to the
   body of academic knowledge. The paper adopts a design science approach
   to formulate the problem statement, articulate the objectives of target
   solutions, and propose a design and development framework for future
   mental health chatbots by employing an extensive literature review.
   Findings from this paper emphasize considerations of ethical issues and
   governance, purposeful and goal-oriented design, and AI-based technology
   as critical enablers for designing new mental health chatbots. The paper
   contributes to the knowledge by providing clear and structured future
   research priorities and offers a framework for designing more effective
   and intelligent mental health chatbots that public organizations and
   managers may find useful.},

Title = {The imperative for regulatory oversight of large language models (or
   generative AI) in healthcare},
Journal = {NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the
   development of sophisticated large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4
   and Bard. The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings
   has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse
   applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining
   insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as
   a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and
   concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very
   cautious approach since these models are trained differently from
   AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially
   within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version,
   GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this
   technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling
   results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being
   an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the
   context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in
   medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and
   transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure
   safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We
   argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and
   patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or
   privacy. This paper summarizes our practical recommendations for what we
   can expect from regulators to bring this vision to reality.},

Abstract = {Technology has played an important role in responding to the novel
   coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and subsequent COVID-19 pandemic. The virus's
   blend of lethality and transmissibility have challenged officials and
   exposed critical limitations of the traditional public health apparatus.
   However, throughout this pandemic, technology has answered the call for
   a new form of public health that illustrates opportunities for enhanced
   agility, scale, and responsiveness. The authors share the Microsoft
   perspective and illustrate how technology has helped transform the
   public health landscape with new and refined capabilities - the efficacy
   and impact of which will be determined by history. Technologies like
   chatbot and virtualized patient care offer a mechanism to triage and
   distribute care at scale. Artificial intelligence and high-performance
   computing have accelerated research into understanding the virus and
   developing targeted therapeutics to treat infection and prevent
   transmission. New mobile contact tracing protocols that preserve patient
   privacy and civil liberties were developed in response to public
   concerns, creating new opportunities for privacy-sensitive technologies
   that aid efforts to prevent and control outbreaks. While much progress
   is still needed, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted technology's
   importance to public health security and pandemic preparedness. Future
   multi-stakeholder collaborations, including those with technology
   organizations, are needed to facilitate progress in overcoming the
   current pandemic, setting the stage for improved pandemic preparedness
   in the future. As lessons are assessed from the current pandemic, public
   officials should consider technology's role and continue to seek
   opportunities to supplement and improve on traditional approaches.},

Abstract = {The recent emergence of publically facing artificial intelligence (AI)
   chatbots has generated vigorous discussion in the lay public around the

   the future adoption of this technology including the transparency of the
   training data used in developing these models, the level of oversight
   and trustworthiness of the information generated, and possible impacts
   on equity, bias, and patient privacy. A stepwise and balanced approach

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have been progressing
   constantly and being more visible in different aspects of our lives. One
   recent phenomenon is ChatGPT, a chatbot with a conversational artificial
   intelligence interface that was developed by OpenAI. As one of the most
   advanced artificial intelligence applications, ChatGPT has drawn much
   public attention across the globe. In this regard, this study examines
   ChatGPT in education, among early adopters, through a qualitative
   instrumental case study. Conducted in three stages, the first stage of
   the study reveals that the public discourse in social media is generally
   positive and there is enthusiasm regarding its use in educational
   settings. However, there are also voices who are approaching cautiously
   using ChatGPT in educational settings. The second stage of the study
   examines the case of ChatGPT through lenses of educational
   transformation, response quality, usefulness, personality and emotion,
   and ethics. In the third and final stage of the study, the investigation
   of user experiences through ten educational scenarios revealed various
   issues, including cheating, honesty and truthfulness of ChatGPT, privacy
   misleading, and manipulation. The findings of this study provide several
   research directions that should be considered to ensure a safe and
   responsible adoption of chatbots, specifically ChatGPT, in education.},

Title = {Intelligent Conversational Agents in Mental Healthcare Services: A
   Thematic Analysis of User Perceptions},

Abstract = {Background: The emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) based
   Conversational Agents (CA) capable of delivering evidence-based
   psychotherapy presents a unique opportunity to solve longstanding issues
   such as social stigma and demand-supply imbalance associated with
   traditional mental health care services. However, the emerging
   literature points to several socio-ethical challenges which may act as
   inhibitors to the adoption in the minds of the consumers. We also
   observe a paucity of research focusing on determinants of adoption and
   use of AI-based CAs in mental healthcare. In this setting, this study
   aims to understand the factors influencing the adoption and use of
   Intelligent CAs in mental healthcare by examining the perceptions of
   actual users.
   Method: The study followed a qualitative approach based on netnography
   and used a rigorous iterative thematic analysis of publicly available
   user reviews of popular mental health chatbots to develop a
   comprehensive framework of factors influencing the user's decision to
   adopt mental healthcare CA.
   Results: We developed a comprehensive thematic map comprising of four
   main themes, namely, perceived risk, perceived benefits, trust, and
   perceived anthropomorphism, along with its 12 constituent subthemes that
   provides a visualization of the factors that govern the user's adoption
   and use of mental healthcare CA.
   Conclusions: Insights from our research could guide future research on
   mental healthcare CA use behavior. Additionally, it could also aid
   designers in framing better design decisions that meet consumer
   expectations. Our research could also guide healthcare policymakers and
   regulators in integrating this technology into formal healthcare
   delivery systems.},

Title = {Chatbots in retailers' customer communication: How to measure their
   acceptance?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RETAILING AND CONSUMER SERVICES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {56},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Currently, online retailers evaluate whether chatbots-software programs
   that interact with users using natural languages-could improve their
   customers' satisfaction. In a retail context, chatbots allow humans to
   pose shopping-related questions and receive answers in natural language
   without waiting for a salesperson or using other automated communication
   forms. However, until now, it has been unclear which customers accept
   this new communication form and which factors determine their
   acceptance. In this paper, we contrast the well-known technology
   acceptance model (TAM) with the lesser known uses and gratifications
   (U\&G) theory, applying both approaches to measure the acceptance of the
   text-based ``Emma{''} chatbot by its target segment. ``Emma{''} was
   developed for the prepurchase phase of online fashion retailing and
   integrated into Facebook Messenger by the major German online retailer
   Zalando. Data were collected from 205 German Millennial respondents in a
   usability study. The results show that both utilitarian factors such as
   ``authenticity of conversation{''} and ``perceived usefulness,{''} as
   well as hedonic factors such as ``perceived enjoyment{''}, positively
   influence the acceptance of ``Emma{''}. However, privacy concerns and
   the immaturity of the technology had a negative effect on usage
   intention and frequency. The predictive power of both models was
   similar, showing little deviation, but U\&G gives alternative insights
   into the customers' motivation to use ``Emma{''} compared to the TAM.},

Title = {Value Co-Creation in Smart Services: A Functional Affordances
   Perspective on Smart Personal Assistants},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {418-458},
Abstract = {In the realm of smart services, smart personal assistants (SPAs) have
   become a popular medium for value co-creation between service providers
   and users. The market success of SPAs is largely based on their
   innovative material properties, such as natural language user
   interfaces, machine learning-powered request handling and service
   provision, and anthropomorphism. In different combinations, these
   properties offer users entirely new ways to intuitively and
   interactively achieve their goals and thus co-create value with service
   providers. But how does the nature of the SPA shape value co-creation
   processes? In this paper, we look through a functional affordances lens
   to theorize about the effects of different types of SPAs (i.e., with
   different combinations of material properties) on users' value
   co-creation processes. Specifically, we collected SPAs from research and
   practice by reviewing scientific literature and web resources, developed
   a taxonomy of SPAs' material properties, and performed a cluster
   analysis to group SPAs of a similar nature. We then derived 2 general
   and 11 cluster-specific propositions on how different material
   properties of SPAs can yield different affordances for value
   co-creation. With our work, we point out that smart services require
   researchers and practitioners to fundamentally rethink value co-creation
   as well as revise affordances theory to address the dynamic nature of
   smart technology as a service counterpart.},

Title = {Monolingual and Cross-Lingual Intent Detection without Training Data in
   Target Languages},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Due to recent DNN advancements, many NLP problems can be effectively
   solved using transformer-based models and supervised data.
   Unfortunately, such data is not available in some languages. This
   research is based on assumptions that (1) training data can be obtained
   by the machine translating it from another language; (2) there are
   cross-lingual solutions that work without the training data in the
   target language. Consequently, in this research, we use the English
   dataset and solve the intent detection problem for five target languages
   (German, French, Lithuanian, Latvian, and Portuguese). When seeking the
   most accurate solutions, we investigate BERT-based word and sentence
   transformers together with eager learning classifiers (CNN, BERT
   fine-tuning, FFNN) and lazy learning approach (Cosine similarity as the
   memory-based method). We offer and evaluate several strategies to
   overcome the data scarcity problem with machine translation,
   cross-lingual models, and a combination of the previous two. The
   experimental investigation revealed the robustness of sentence
   transformers under various cross-lingual conditions. The accuracy equal
   to similar to 0.842 is achieved with the English dataset with completely
   monolingual models is considered our top-line. However, cross-lingual
   approaches demonstrate similar accuracy levels reaching similar to
   0.831, similar to 0.829, similar to 0.853, similar to 0.831, and similar
   to 0.813 on German, French, Lithuanian, Latvian, and Portuguese
   languages.},
