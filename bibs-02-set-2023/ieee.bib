  abstract={With chatbots gaining traction and their adoption growing in different verticals, e.g. Health, Banking, Dating; and users sharing more and more private information with chatbots - studies have started to highlight the privacy risks of chatbots. In this paper, we propose two privacypreserving approaches for chatbot conversations. The first approach applies `entity' based privacy filtering and transformation, and can be applied directly on the app (client) side. It however requires knowledge of the chatbot design to be enabled. We present a second scheme based on Searchable Encryption that is able to preserve user chat privacy, without requiring any knowledge of the chatbot design. Finally, we present some experimental results based on a real-life employee Help Desk chatbot that validates both the need and feasibility of the proposed approaches.},

  pages={86-90},
  abstract={Children's privacy concerns about smart toys are becoming more and more critical in the toy industry. Parents and guardians continue to strive to protect their children from unnecessary privacy risks such as collection, and unconsented use of or access to their children's information. However, there is still no standardized privacy framework, which focuses on smart toys in this paradigm; making it difficult to determine possible privacy violation in for example determining whether a phrase shared with a smart toy is sensitive or not. To overcome this challenge, we build a privacy identification system through Chatbot technology. We call this system a Children Privacy Identification (CPI) system. To develop CPI system, we divide our research works into two parts: (1) Collect the phrase from the smart toys; and (2) Explore privacy Identification based on Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). For illustration, we integrate the CPI system in LINE Chatbot. The result shows that people feel more comfortable in talking to LINE Chatbot with privacy protection.},

  abstract={Mental health chatbots can provide psychological counseling services to patients at any time regardless of time and location, which can not only relieve patients’ ailments but also reduce the workload of psychologists. In order to provide patients with accurate diagnosis and treatment services, mental health robots inevitably collect patient-related information during the communication process with patients, which is often very sensitive and must be well protected. There is a lack of targeted research on how mental health chatbots can provide systematic privacy preserving for patients in the process of providing mental health services to them. In this paper, we propose a privacy preserving framework based on blockchain and confidential computing that can provide comprehensive privacy preserving for patients during mental health chatbot services. We conduct tests using existing mental health chatbots, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework can meet the requirements for privacy preserving and computational performance of mental health chatbots.},

  abstract={In today's digital age, the importance of preserving and organizing important documents and information cannot be overstated. To create a comprehensive solution for secure file sharing through the use of a Telegram chatbot. The bot will have the ability to encrypt and decrypt files, allowing users to share sensitive information with confidence. The encryption and decryption will be performed using AES algorithms to ensure the security of the files. To further enhance security and scalability, the chatbot will be deployed to a cloud platform, allowing it to be accessed from anywhere and handle a larger number of users. Additionally, this project will also focus on implementing data preservation functionality within the chatbot. This will ensure that files are retained and accessible even when they are deleted from the Telegram chat or when the chatbot is deployed to the doud. This will be achieved through techniques such as data backup and disaster recovery to ensure data availability. Overall, this aims to provide a secure and reliable system for sharing files through Telegram, that guarantees the security of the files, the availability of the data and the scalability of the system. It is tailored for organizations, businesses and individuals who need to share sensitive information regularly.},

  abstract={So far, we have proposed the Stress management framework and developed methods for stress measurement and coping. There are three types of coping in this framework: information support, emotional support, and esteem support. This time, we developed esteem support. In order to increase self-esteem, we focused on psychodrama techniques and developed a system to realize psychodrama using robots. The advantages of using robots include the ability to carry out a psychodrama alone and to provide privacy-friendly support. In the experiment, a scenario was created for medical staff and a robot psychodrama was performed. As a result, we showed that robots can be used for psychodrama and esteem support can be carried out by combination of robots and the chatbot.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},

  pages={1634-1642},
  abstract={Over the past decade, the use of chatbots for educational purposes has gained considerable traction. A similar trend has been observed in social coding platforms, where automated agents support software developers with tasks such as performing code reviews. While incorporating code reviews and social coding platforms into software engineering education has been found to be beneficial, challenges such as steep learning curves and privacy considerations are barriers to their adoption. Furthermore, no study has addressed the role chatbots play in supporting code reviews as a pedagogical tool. To help address this gap, we developed an online learning application that simulates the code review features available on social coding platforms and allows instructors to interact with students using chatbot identities. We then embedded this application within a lesson on software engineering best practices and conducted a controlled in-class experiment. This experiment examined the effect that explaining content via chatbot identities had on three aspects: (i) students’ perceived usability of the lesson, (ii) their engagement with the code review process, and (iii) their learning gains. While our findings show that it is feasible to simulate the code review process within an online learning platform and achieve good usability, our quantitative analysis did not yield significant differences across treatment conditions for any of the aspects considered. Nevertheless, our qualitative results suggest that students expect explicit feedback when performing this type of exercise and could thus benefit from automated replies provided by an interactive chatbot. We propose to build on our current findings to further explore this line of research in future work.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={367-370},
  abstract={Globally, the problem of chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease is getting worse. These diseases have a significant impact on patients and healthcare systems. Innovative technologies like chatbots, which promise to improve the management of chronic diseases, have emerged as potential solutions to these difficulties. Chatbots are man-made brainpower (artificial intelligence) programs that can recreate discussions with people and give customized and practical consideration. The primary purposes of this study are to investigate the most important applications of chatbots in the management of chronic diseases, including personalized education, symptom monitoring, medication management, and lifestyle coaching. In addition, it discusses the potential advantages and disadvantages of chatbots in the management of chronic diseases, including the need for human oversight, data privacy, and patient engagement. The paper concludes that, although chatbots have the potential to transform the management of chronic diseases by providing personalized and cost-effective care, careful consideration of ethical, legal, and regulatory frameworks is required for their integration into healthcare systems.},

  abstract={AI technology is being introduced into various public and private service domains, transforming existing computing systems or creating new ones. While AI technologies can provide benefits to humans and society, the unexpected consequences (e.g., malfunctions) of AI systems can cause social losses. For this reason, research on ethical design for the development of AI-based systems is becoming important. In this paper, from existing studies on AI ethics, general guidelines such as transparency, explainability, predictability, accountability, fairness, privacy, and control for the ethical design of AI systems are reviewed. And, based on the ethical design guidelines, we discuss ethical design to reduce the negative effects of biased data and unethical dialogues in AI-based conversational chatbots.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={296-301},
  abstract={Customer service plays a crucial role for a company. As an important aspect of e-commerce companies, they would be required to directly interact and try to solve customers’ problems that might occur anywhere and anytime. However, the limitation of human man hours became a barrier to overcome customers’ problems. On one hand, the rapid development of technology was predicted to replace the traditional human customer service with an Artificial Intelligence agent. On the other hand, this replacement affects the customer satisfaction. This paper performed a study literature review to discover the effect of chatbots and its impact towards customer satisfaction. In an e-commerce customer service use case, chatbots could be implemented in a number of methods. The methods implemented by chatbots are avatar-based, verbal-based, text-based, and menu-based. Research showed that text-based chatbot is the most commonly used methodology and has advanced the most, where some are implementing higher level machine learning methods, such as deep learning. The usage of such chatbot in e-commerce customer service systems will lower the cost but might also lower customer satisfaction, due to reasons such as unsatisfying answers and inhuman behavior. Research showed that even a more sophisticated chatbot doesn’t always mean higher customer satisfaction, even with high accuracy ratings. To look into customer satisfaction, this paper has identified 4 aspects of a chatbot that are relevant to customer satisfaction, which are privacy, reliability, personalization, and responsiveness. Chatbots currently excel in some of these quality measures, but require further research to effectively replace human customer service agents.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={146-151},
  abstract={Mental health is one of the most pressing challenges in today's modern world. Traditional thinking, family pressure, unemployment issues, homesickness, and an unhappy relationship are the most common reasons for mental illness, which may also lead to suicidal attempts. People in impoverished countries do not give this issue enough attention. Furthermore, many are hesitant to seek professional counseling from a psychiatrist to retain their privacy. Monitoring social media activities, in addition to common symptoms, is critical for improving the accuracy of detecting early signs of mental illness because it impacts mental health. So, rather than a psychiatrist, a user-friendly deep learning-based mobile application that will chat with them to support and monitor their social media behaviors to determine their mental health status will be an effective way of handling the situation. This study proposes a deep learning-based chatbot framework to help mentally ill individuals identify their mental health conditions and provide appropriate therapy. This framework comprises three components: a keylogger module, a chat module, and a deep learning-based mental illness detection module. In the background, the keylogger collects data from the user's keyboard to track social media activity. The chatbot converses with users and stores their daily chat history in real-time. Both modules pass the data to a deep learning model to determine mental health conditions. This study also compared the accuracy of multiple deep learning classifiers such as Conv-LSTM and BERT for the Reddit Mental Health Dataset.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been around for more than fifty years. However, current improvements in processing power, the accessibility of huge amounts of data, and improved algorithms have led to significant advancements in AI. A chatbot is a software program with AI that simulates user interactions. Healthcare chatbots gradually eliminate hospital wait times, appointments, and consultation meetups, thus instantly assisting patients in connecting with the right doctor. Chatbots reduce the workload of healthcare providers by decreasing the number of hospital visits and unnecessary treatments, providing suggestions and alerts. However, the introduction of such chatbots in the healthcare domain exposes users to a plethora of challenges. This paper presents a systematic survey of recent developments by researchers in the field of healthcare chatbots. This research brings to light general information regarding the application type, various technologies and evaluation methods that have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of healthcare chatbots and aims to serve as a research guideline which may be valuable for the development of chatbots in various fields.},

  abstract={Undoubtedly, the evolution of Generative AI (GenAI) models has been the highlight of digital transformation in the year 2022. As the different GenAI models like ChatGPT and Google Bard continue to foster their complexity and capability, it’s critical to understand its consequences from a cybersecurity perspective. Several instances recently have demonstrated the use of GenAI tools in both the defensive and offensive side of cybersecurity, and focusing on the social, ethical and privacy implications this technology possesses. This research paper highlights the limitations, challenges, potential risks, and opportunities of GenAI in the domain of cybersecurity and privacy. The work presents the vulnerabilities of ChatGPT, which can be exploited by malicious users to exfiltrate malicious information bypassing the ethical constraints on the model. This paper demonstrates successful example attacks like Jailbreaks, reverse psychology, and prompt injection attacks on the ChatGPT. The paper also investigates how cyber offenders can use the GenAI tools in developing cyber attacks, and explore the scenarios where ChatGPT can be used by adversaries to create social engineering attacks, phishing attacks, automated hacking, attack payload generation, malware creation, and polymorphic malware. This paper then examines defense techniques and uses GenAI tools to improve security measures, including cyber defense automation, reporting, threat intelligence, secure code generation and detection, attack identification, developing ethical guidelines, incidence response plans, and malware detection. We will also discuss the social, legal, and ethical implications of ChatGPT. In conclusion, the paper highlights open challenges and future directions to make this GenAI secure, safe, trustworthy, and ethical as the community understands its cybersecurity impacts.},

Anonymous communication has been studied by many scholars (Choudhury, Sharon, Watt, Zhang, etc), but it seems that more questions are left unanswered. This paper starts distinguishing anonymity from related notions of confidentiality and secrecy, privacy, and publicity. We provide some vocabulary to talk about anonymization and identification efforts by message sources and receivers. The paper highlights some of the limitations of current communication scholarship in this area such as anonymous communication strategy. The growing role of the Telegram messenger in the mass communications systems of Russia and Belarus indicates new opportunities for anonymous communication strategy in the digital society. The research methodology is based on a comparative analysis of statistical data on the audience of the leading Telegram news channels. The authors argue that the anonymous communication strategy has taken an important share of the market in both countries. In a comparative aspect, the indicators of the involvement of Telegram channels were analyzed. The main results of the study show that the use of various Telegram features both as a messenger and as a full-fledged media is constantly increasing. The intensity of the use of the messenger has increased and the variety of functions it performs has also increased. It has been established that the Telegram platform contributes to strengthening feedback from the audience. Chatbots have become a new opportunity to receive information from readers. The authors conclude that alternative Telegram channels play an important role in the digital environment.},

  abstract={Smart home voice assistants (VAs) such as Amazon Echo and Google Home have become popular because of the convenience they provide through voice commands. VAs continuously listen to detect the wake command and send the subsequent audio data to the manufacturer-owned cloud service for processing to identify actionable commands. However, research has shown that VAs are prone to replay attack and accidental activations when the wake words are spoken in the background (either by a human or played through a mechanical speaker). Existing privacy controls are not effective in preventing such misactivations. This raises privacy and security concerns for the users as their conversations can be recorded and relayed to the cloud without their knowledge. Recent studies have shown that the visual gaze plays an important role when interacting with conservation agents such as VAs, and users tend to turn their heads or body toward the VA when invoking it. In this paper, we propose a device-free, non-obtrusive acoustic sensing system called HeadTalk to thwart the misactivation of VAs. The proposed system leverages the user's head direction information and verifies that a human generates the sound to minimize accidental activations. Our extensive evaluation shows that HeadTalk can accurately infer a speaker's head orientation with an average accuracy of 96.14\% and distinguish human voice from a mechanical speaker with an equal error rate of 2.58\%. We also conduct a user interaction study to assess how users perceive our proposed approach compared to existing privacy controls. Our results suggest that HeadTalk can not only enhance the security and privacy controls for VAs but do so in a usable way without requiring any additional hardware.},

  abstract={Psychosis iREACH aims to optimize the delivery of evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy to family caregivers who have a loved one with psychosis. It is an accessible digital platform that can utilize the user’s intent and entities to determine the appropriate response. The platform is implemented based on an artificial intelligence and natural language understanding (NLU) framework, RASA. We developed the web application of the platform, and the chatbot has been integrated into the platform to collect data and evaluate the performance. The results showed that the NLU model’s accuracy, precision, recall, and F1- score of the intent prediction are 88.31\%, 89.80\%, 88.22\%, and 88.65\% respectively.

  abstract={Social networks have been the widespread popular tools for communication and socialization, and it also been the ideal platform for bots to publish malicious information. Therefore, social bot detection is essential for the social network's security. Existing methods almost ignore the differences in bot behaviors in multiple domains. Thus, we first propose a DomainAware detection method with Multi-Relational Graph neural networks (DA-MRG) to improve detection performance. Specifically, DA-MRG constructs multi-relational graphs with users' features and relationships, obtains the user presentations with graph embedding and distinguishes bots from humans with domainaware classifiers. Meanwhile, considering the similarity between bot behaviors in different social networks, we believe that sharing data among them could boost detection performance. However, the data privacy of users needs to be strictly protected. To overcome the problem, we implement a study of federated learning framework for DA-MRG to achieve data sharing between different social networks and protect data privacy simultaneously. We conduct extensive experiments on TwiBot-20, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively achieve federated social bot detection.},

  abstract={With the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is confronting various healthcare issues, and healthcare automation is more crucial than ever. The pandemic has revealed the limitations of existing digital healthcare systems to manage public health emergencies. There is no registered population for many healthcare institutions in Sri Lanka, as a result, there is a communication gap. Electronic Health Record systems (EHRs) are becoming popular to share patient details but accessing scattered data across several EHRs while safeguarding patient privacy remains a challenge. Most of these medical records are in printed format and manually entering those into EHR systems is time-consuming and error prone. Not only that pharmaceutical error is a critical healthcare problem, but it is even riskier to visit doctors for pharmaceutical diagnosis during a pandemic. This research introduces a Blockchain-based patient health record system, an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) based Medical Document Scanner, a Drug Identifier based on Image Processing and a Medical Chatbot powered by NLP as four novel approaches to address these issues. Altogether with the results, this research aims at introducing a solution for the limitations in healthcare while providing a distributed healthcare framework for the healthcare community worldwide.},
