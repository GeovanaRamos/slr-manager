Abstract = {Background: Conversational agents (CAs), also known as chatbots, are
   computer programs that simulate human conversations by using
   predetermined rule-based responses or artificial intelligence
   algorithms. They are increasingly used in health care, particularly via
   smartphones. There is, at present, no conceptual framework guiding the
   development of smartphone-based, rule-based CAs in health care. To fill
   this gap, we propose structured and tailored guidance for their design,
   development, evaluation, and implementation. Objective: The aim of this
   study was to develop a conceptual framework for the design, evaluation,
   and implementation of smartphone-delivered, rule-based, goal-oriented,
   and text-based CAs for health care. Methods: We followed the approach by
   Jabareen, which was based on the grounded theory method, to develop this
   conceptual framework. We performed 2 literature reviews focusing on
   health care CAs and conceptual frameworks for the development of mobile
   health interventions. We identified, named, categorized, integrated, and
   synthesized the information retrieved from the literature reviews to
   develop the conceptual framework. We then applied this framework by
   developing a CA and testing it in a feasibility study. Results: The
   Designing, Developing, Evaluating, and Implementing a
   Smartphone-Delivered, Rule-Based Conversational Agent (DISCOVER)
   conceptual framework includes 8 iterative steps grouped into 3 stages,
   as follows: design, comprising defining the goal, creating an identity,
   assembling the team, and selecting the delivery interface; development,
   including developing the content and building the conversation flow; and
   the evaluation and implementation of the CA. They were complemented by 2
   cross-cuttingconsiderations-user-centered design and privacy and
   security-that were relevant at all stages. This conceptual framework was
   successfully applied in the development of a CA to support lifestyle
   changes and prevent type 2 diabetes. Conclusions: Drawing on published
   evidence, the DISCOVER conceptual framework provides a step-by-step
   guide for developing rule-based, smartphone-delivered CAs. Further
   evaluation of this framework in diverse health care areas and settings
   and for a variety of users is needed to demonstrate its validity. Future
   research should aim to explore the use of CAs to deliver health care
   interventions, including behavior change and potential privacy and
   safety concerns.},

Abstract = {Privacy is one of the key issues for citizen's everyday online
   activities, with the United Nations defining it as ``a human right in
   the digital age{''}. Despite the introduction of data privacy
   regulations almost everywhere around the globe, the biggest barrier to
   effectiveness is the customer's capacity to map the privacy statement
   received with the regulation in force and understand their terms. This
   study advocates the creation of a convenient and cost-efficient
   question-answering service for answering customers' queries on data
   privacy. It proposes a dual step approach, allowing consumers to ask
   support to a conversational agent boosted by a smart knowledge base,
   attempting to answer the question using the most appropriate legal
   document. Being the self-help approach insufficient, our system enacts a
   second step suggesting a ranked list of legal experts for focused
   advice. To achieve our objective, we need large enough and specialised
   dataset and we plan to apply state-of-the-art Natural Language
   Processing (NLP) techniques in the field of open domain question
   answering. This paper describes the initial steps and some early results
   we achieved in this direction and the next steps we propose to develop a
   one-stop solution for consumers privacy needs.},

Abstract = {Children's privacy concerns about smart toys are becoming more and more
   critical in the toy industry. Parents and guardians continue to strive
   to protect their children from unnecessary privacy risks such as
   collection, and unconsented use of or access to their children's
   information. However, there is still no standardized privacy framework,
   which focuses on smart toys in this paradigm; making it difficult to
   determine possible privacy violation in for example determining whether
   a phrase shared with a smart toy is sensitive or not. To overcome this
   challenge, we build a privacy identification system through Chatbot
   technology. We call this system a Children Privacy Identification (CPI)
   system. To develop CPI system, we divide our research works into two
   parts: (1) Collect the phrase from the smart toys; and (2) Explore
   privacy Identification based on Personally Identifiable Information
   (PII) and Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). For
   illustration, we integrate the CPI system in LINE Chatbot. The result
   shows that people feel more comfortable in talking to LINE Chatbot with
   privacy protection.},

Abstract = {With chatbots gaining traction and their adoption growing in different
   verticals, e.g. Health, Banking, Dating; and users sharing more and more
   private information with chatbots - studies have started to highlight
   the privacy risks of chatbots. In this paper, we propose two
   privacy-preserving approaches for chatbot conversations. The first
   approach applies `entity' based privacy filtering and transformation,
   and can be applied directly on the app (client) side. It however
   requires knowledge of the chatbot design to be enabled. We present a
   second scheme based on Searchable Encryption that is able to preserve
   user chat privacy, without requiring any knowledge of the chatbot
   design. Finally, we present some experimental results based on a
   real-life employee Help Desk chatbot that validates both the need and
   feasibility of the proposed approaches.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to examine the antecedents of privacy concerns
   in the era of artificial intelligence. Specifically, it focuses on the
   impact of various factors related to interactions with a chatbot
   (creepiness and perceived risk) and individual traits (familiarity with
   chatbots and need for privacy) in relation to privacy when interacting
   with a chatbot in the context of financial services. The moderating
   effect of gender on these relationships was also examined.
   Design/methodology/approach A total of 430 Canadians responded to an
   online questionnaire after interacting with a chatbot in the context of
   a simulated auto insurance quote. A structural equation model was used
   to test the hypotheses. Findings The results showed that privacy
   concerns are influenced primarily by creepiness, followed by perceived
   risk and the need for privacy. The last two relationships are moderated
   by gender. Conversely, familiarity with chatbots does not affect privacy
   concerns in this context. Originality/value This study is the first to
   consider the influence of creepiness as an antecedent of privacy
   concerns arising from interactions with AI tools and highlight its key
   impacts. It also shows how gender moderates specific relationships in
   this context.},

Abstract = {This comprehensive critical review critically examines the ethical
   implications associated with integrating chatbots into nephrology,
   aiming to identify concerns, propose policies, and offer potential
   solutions. Acknowledging the transformative potential of chatbots in
   healthcare, responsible implementation guided by ethical considerations
   is of the utmost importance. The review underscores the significance of
   establishing robust guidelines for data collection, storage, and sharing
   to safeguard privacy and ensure data security. Future research should
   prioritize defining appropriate levels of data access, exploring
   anonymization techniques, and implementing encryption methods.
   Transparent data usage practices and obtaining informed consent are
   fundamental ethical considerations. Effective security measures,
   including encryption technologies and secure data transmission
   protocols, are indispensable for maintaining the confidentiality and
   integrity of patient data. To address potential biases and
   discrimination, the review suggests regular algorithm reviews, diversity
   strategies, and ongoing monitoring. Enhancing the clarity of chatbot
   capabilities, developing user-friendly interfaces, and establishing
   explicit consent procedures are essential for informed consent. Striking
   a balance between automation and human intervention is vital to preserve
   the doctor-patient relationship. Cultural sensitivity and multilingual
   support should be considered through chatbot training. To ensure ethical
   chatbot utilization in nephrology, it is imperative to prioritize the
   development of comprehensive ethical frameworks encompassing data
   handling, security, bias mitigation, informed consent, and
   collaboration. Continuous research and innovation in this field are
   crucial for maximizing the potential of chatbot technology and
   ultimately improving patient outcomes.},

Abstract = {The rise of AI has prompted the financial business to enter the
   intelligent financial technology (FinTech). Chatbot with AI technologies
   is an important member of FinTech. The financial industry is actively
   introducing chatbot to enhance the market competitive advantage. Many
   banks and card issuers in the United States have introduced or developed
   chatbots from 2017 to increase user convenience and assist business
   promotion of financial institutions. However, chatbot with AI features
   may infringe customer security and personal privacy. Security has become
   an important issue that Chatbot must pay attention to. In order to
   improve the security of chatbot, this paper analyzes the security
   strategies of e-commerce (EC), and combines the AI security principles
   to plan the Chatbot Security Control Procedure (CSCP). CSCP uses
   security specifications confirmation, specifications implementation,
   inspection activity and improvement manners four stages to monitor
   chatbot. Banking chatbot with CSPS can hold advantages of chatbots,
   reduce the security risk, and concretely protect customer data security
   and personal privacy.},

Abstract = {Difference in features of voice such as tone, volume, intonation, and
   rate of speech have been suggested as sensitive and valid measures of
   mental illness. Researchers have used analysis of voice recordings
   during phone calls, response to the IVR systems and smartphone based
   conversational agents as a marker in continuous monitoring of symptoms
   and effect of treatment in patients with mental illness. While these
   methods of recording the patient's voice have been considered efficient,
   they come with a number of issues in terms of adoption, privacy,
   security, data storage etc. To address these issues we propose a smart
   speaker based conversational agent - ``Hear me out{''}. In this paper,
   we describe the proposed system, rationale behind using smart speakers,
   and the challenges we are facing in the design of the system.},

Title = {Conversational Agents in Health Care: Expert Interviews to Inform the
   Definition, Classification, and Conceptual Framework},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Background: Conversational agents (CAs), or chatbots, are computer
   programs that simulate conversations with humans. The use of CAs in
   health care settings is recent and rapidly increasing, which often
   translates to poor reporting of the CA development and evaluation
   processes and unreliable research findings. We developed and published a
   conceptual framework, designing, developing, evaluating, and
   implementing a smartphone-delivered, rule-based conversational agent
   (DISCOVER), consisting of 3 iterative stages of CA design, development,
   and evaluation and implementation, complemented by 2 cross-cutting
   themes (user-centered design and data privacy and security).
   Objective: This study aims to perform in-depth, semistructured
   interviews with multidisciplinary experts in health care CAs to share
   their views on the definition and classification of health care CAs and
   evaluate and validate the DISCOVER conceptual framework.
   Methods: We conducted one-on-one semistructured interviews via Zoom
   (Zoom Video Communications) with 12 multidisciplinary CA experts using
   an interview guide based on our framework. The interviews were audio
   recorded, transcribed by the research team, and analyzed using thematic
   analysis.
   Results: Following participants' input, we defined CAs as digital
   interfaces that use natural language to engage in a synchronous dialogue
   using >= 1 communication modality, such as text, voice, images, or
   video. CAs were classified by 13 categories: response generation method,
   input and output modalities, CA purpose, deployment platform, CA
   development modality, appearance, length of interaction, type of CA-user
   interaction, dialogue initiation, communication style, CA personality,
   human support, and type of health care intervention. Experts considered
   that the conceptual framework could be adapted for artificial
   intelligence-based CAs. However, despite recent advances in artificial
   intelligence, including large language models, the technology is not
   able to ensure safety and reliability in health care settings. Finally,
   aligned with participants' feedback, we present an updated iteration of
   the conceptual framework for health care conversational agents (CHAT)
   with key considerations for CA design, development, and evaluation and
   implementation, complemented by 3 cross-cutting themes: ethics, user
   involvement, and data privacy and security.
   Conclusions: We present an expanded, validated CHAT and aim at guiding
   researchers from a variety of backgrounds and with different levels of
   expertise in the design, development, and evaluation and implementation
   of rule-based CAs in health care settings.},

Abstract = {Chatbots are artificial communication systems becoming increasingly
   popular and not all their security questions are clearly solved. People
   use chatbots for assistance in shopping, bank communication, meal
   delivery, healthcare, cars, and many other actions. However, it brings
   an additional security risk and creates serious security challenges
   which have to be handled. Understanding the underlying problems requires
   defining the crucial steps in the techniques used to design chatbots
   related to security. There are many factors increasing security threats
   and vulnerabilities. All of them are comprehensively studied, and
   security practices to decrease security weaknesses are presented. Modern
   chatbots are no longer rule-based models, but they employ modern natural
   language and machine learning techniques. Such techniques learn from a
   conversation, which can contain personal information. The paper
   discusses circumstances under which such data can be used and how
   chatbots treat them. Many chatbots operate on a social/messaging
   platform, which has their terms and conditions about data. The paper
   aims to present a comprehensive study of security aspects in
   communication with chatbots. The article could open a discussion and
   highlight the problems of data storage and usage obtained from the
   communication user-chatbot and propose some standards to protect the
   user.},

Abstract = {The present research focuses on the interplay between two common
   features of the customer service chatbot experience: gaze direction and
   anthropomorphism. Although the dominant approach in marketing theory and
   practice is to make chatbots as human-like as possible, the current
   study, built on the humanness-value-loyalty model, addresses the chain
   of effects through which chatbots' nonverbal behaviors affect customers'
   willingness to disclose personal information and purchase intentions. By
   means of two experiments that adopt a real chatbot in a simulated
   shopping environment (i.e., car rental and travel insurance), the
   present work allows us to understand how to reduce individuals' tendency
   to see conversational agents as less knowledgeable and empathetic
   compared with humans. The results show that warmth perceptions are
   affected by gaze direction, whereas competence perceptions are affected
   by anthropomorphism. Warmth and competence perceptions are found to be
   key drivers of consumers' skepticism toward the chatbot, which, in turn,
   affects consumers' trust toward the service provider hosting the
   chatbot, ultimately leading consumers to be more willing to disclose
   their personal information and to repatronize the e-tailer in the
   future. Building on the Theory of Mind, our results show that perceiving
   competence from a chatbot makes individuals less skeptical as long as
   they feel they are good at detecting others' ultimate intentions.},

Abstract = {Context. Asynchronous messaging is increasingly used to support
   human-machine interactions, generally implemented through chatbots. Such
   virtual entities assist the users in activities of different kinds
   (e.g., work, leisure, and health-related) and are becoming ingrained
   into humans' habits due to factors including (i) the availability of
   mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, (ii) the increasingly
   engaging nature of chatbot interactions, (iii) the release of dedicated
   APIs from messaging platforms, and (iv) increasingly complex AI-based
   mechanisms to power the bots' behaviors. Nevertheless, most of the
   modern chatbots rely on state machines (implementing conversational
   rules) and one-fits-all approaches, neglecting personalization,
   data-stream privacy management, multi-topic management/interconnection,
   and multimodal interactions. Objective. This work addresses the
   challenges above through an agent-based framework for chatbot
   development named EREBOTS. Methods. The foundations of the framework are
   based on the implementation of (i) multi-front-end connectors and
   interfaces (i.e., Telegram, dedicated App, and web interface), (ii)
   enabling the configuration of multi-scenario behaviors (i.e., preventive
   physical conditioning, smoking cessation, and support for breast-cancer
   survivors), (iii) online learning, (iv) personalized conversations and
   recommendations (i.e., mood boost, anti-craving persuasion, and
   balance-preserving physical exercises), and (v) responsive multi-device
   monitoring interface (i.e., doctor and admin). Results. EREBOTS has been
   tested in the context of physical balance preservation in social
   confinement times (due to the ongoing pandemic). Thirteen individuals
   characterized by diverse age, gender, and country distribution have
   actively participated in the experimentation, reporting advancements in
   the physical balance and overall satisfaction of the interaction and
   exercises' variety they have been proposed.},

Abstract = {This study explored digital privacy concerns in the use of chatbots as a
   digital banking service. Three dimensions of trust were tested in
   relation to user self-disclosure in order to better understand the
   consumer-chatbot experience in banking. The methodology selected for
   this research study followed a conclusive, pre-experimental, two-group
   one-shot case study research design which made use of a non-probability
   snowballing sampling technique. Privacy concerns were found to have a
   significantly negative relationship with user self-disclosure in both
   treatment groups. Respondents exposed to their preferred banking brand
   experienced lower user self-disclosure and brand trust than those
   exposed to a fictitious banking brand within the South African context.
   It is recommended that companies using chatbots focus on easing privacy
   concerns and build foundations of trust. The gains that chatbots have
   made in the form of increased productivity and quality of customer
   service rely on relationships with users who need to disclose personal
   information. Through this study, we concluded that, despite its power to
   influence decision-making, the power of a brand is not enough for
   consumers to considerably increase self-disclosure. Rather, a bridge of
   trust (through education, communication and product development) is
   needed that encompasses all three elements of trust, which are brand
   trust, cognitive trust and emotional trust. Limited research exists on
   the relationship between financial services marketing and chatbot
   adoption. Thus, this study addressed a theoretical gap, by adding brand
   trust to existing studies on cognitive and emotional trust regarding
   user self-disclosure.},

Abstract = {Intelligent Chatbot services become one of the mainstream applications
   in user help and many other areas. Apart from bringing numerous benefits
   to users these services may bring additional risks to the companies that
   employ them. The study starts with the review of the scale of chatbot
   industry and common use cases by focusing on their applications \&
   industry tendencies. Review of functionality and architecture of typical
   chatbot services shows the potential risks associated with chatbots.
   Analysis of such risks in the paper helped to build a checklist that
   security managers can use to assess risks prior to chatbot
   implementation. The proposed checklist was tested by reviewing a number
   of Service Level Agreements (SLA) of real chatbot providers.},

   Influencing User Satisfaction and Engagement},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 12},
Abstract = {With the increasing integration of chatbots in various customer service
   contexts, understanding factors that influence user interactions is of
   paramount importance. While chatbots bring several benefits, their
   efficacy largely depends on user satisfaction, loyalty, and perceived
   utility. This study explores the nuances of consumer interactions with
   chatbot services and identifies ways to enhance these interactions for
   successful goal achievement. Through a multiple qualitative method
   approach, involving reflections, interviews, and focus groups, conducted
   an exhaustive investigation of the consumer experiences with chatbot
   interactions. The study focused on elements such as anthropomorphism,
   communication styles, service scripts, consumer emotions, and privacy
   and trust concerns. Our findings highlight that the anthropomorphism and
   communication style of chatbots significantly affect user satisfaction.
   The perceived utility of chatbots was found to be a multifaceted
   construct that substantially influences consumer engagement.
   Furthermore, this study identified negative emotions and privacy
   concerns as key determinants of consumer-chatbot interactions. These
   findings necessitate meticulous attention in chatbot design and
   function. By using the affordance theory, this research offers insights
   into managing the complex dynamics of satisfaction and dissatisfaction
   factors within consumer-chatbot engagements, contributing crucially to
   the human-computer interaction literature.},

Month = {2023 OCT 27},
Abstract = {Since chatbots have been integrated into people's lives from various
   industries, human-chatbot interaction has begun to attract widespread
   attention in academia. Still, contributions to the systematic mapping of
   this field are lacking. This paper is the first to present a systematic
   review of human-chatbot interaction research using bibliometric
   analysis. A total of 3013 publications (from the year 2000 to 2022) from
   Web of Science database were analysed to uncover the current status and
   research trend in human-chatbot interaction domain. The analysis focused
   on temporal and geographical distribution of these publications and
   identified the most influential publication outlets, institutes,
   articles, and authors. Additionally, keyword co-occurrence analysis and
   temporal distribution of keywords showed that primary topics in
   human-chatbot interaction mainly concentrate on techniques and methods
   in chatbot systems design, extensive applications in various fields,
   user experience and emotional expression, humanizing features design,
   and perceived privacy risk and ethics. Finally, this paper sheds light
   on a comprehensive understanding of human-chatbot interaction research
   and provides directions for future research in this field.},

Abstract = {The application of artificial intelligence is considered essential to
   adapt to a new cycle of industrial trans-formation and technological
   advancements in many fields and industries. The extensive use of
   artificial intel-ligence technology is expected to improve the level and
   quality of services provided by companies adopting these methods. In
   this study, we propose a novel approach to self-recovery by chatbot
   systems after service failures based on social response theory.
   Moreover, we explore differences in consumer perceptions of different
   service recovery types and their impact on recovery satisfaction, and
   discusses whether the intelligence of the compu-tational agent also has
   an effect. We present the results of three scenario-based experiments,
   which demonstrate the positive effect of chatbot self-recovery on
   consumer satisfaction, and show the mediating paths of service recovery
   types in terms of perceived functional value and privacy risks as well
   as the boundary condition of the level of robot intelligence. This work
   expands the range of applications of chatbots in the service industry
   and provides a new framework for the governance of artificial

Abstract = {Purpose Chatbot technology is expected to revolutionize customer service
   in financial institutions. However, the adoption of customer service
   chatbots in banking remains low. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to
   identify relevant segments of potential banking chatbot users based on
   technology adoption behavior.
   Design/Methodology/Approach - Data for the research was collected
   through an online questionnaire in Romania using the non-probability
   sampling method. The 287 questionnaires were analyzed using hierarchical
   and k-means cluster analysis.
   Findings and implications - The analysis revealed three distinct
   segments: Innovators (2696), consisting of highly educated young women
   employed in the business sector; the Late Majority (55\%), consisting of
   young women with higher education degrees who work in services-related
   fields; and Laggards (19\%), consisting of educated middle-aged men
   employed in the business sector. New significant differences among
   demographic: and banking behavior variables weft observed across the
   profiles of potential banking chatbot user segments.
   Limitations - The study is based on a non-probability sample collected
   from only one country, with a rather small sample size.
   Originality -Technology acceptance variables (perceived usefulness,
   perceived ease of use), expanded to include constructs such as awareness
   of service, perceived privacy risk, and perceived compatibility, were
   found to be appro priate for customer segmentation purposes in the
   context of chatbot applications based on artificial intelligence. The
   study also revealed a new innovator demographic profile.},

Abstract = {Chatbots are increasingly becoming important gateways to digital
   services and information-taken up within domains such as customer
   service, health, education, and work support. However, there is only
   limited knowledge concerning the impact of chatbots at the individual,
   group, and societal level. Furthermore, a number of challenges remain to
   be resolved before the potential of chatbots can be fully realized. In
   response, chatbots have emerged as a substantial research area in recent
   years. To help advance knowledge in this emerging research area, we
   propose a research agenda in the form of future directions and
   challenges to be addressed by chatbot research. This proposal
   consolidates years of discussions at the CONVERSATIONS workshop series
   on chatbot research. Following a deliberative research analysis process
   among the workshop participants, we explore future directions within six
   topics of interest: (a) users and implications, (b) user experience and
   design, (c) frameworks and platforms, (d) chatbots for collaboration,
   (e) democratizing chatbots, and (f) ethics and privacy. For each of
   these topics, we provide a brief overview of the state of the art,
   discuss key research challenges, and suggest promising directions for
   future research. The six topics are detailed with a 5-year perspective
   in mind and are to be considered items of an interdisciplinary research
   agenda produced collaboratively by avid researchers in the field.},

Abstract = {In recent years, also due to the covid-19 pandemic, the possibilities
   for distance learning have increased considerably, through web-based
   learning platforms, available on the Internet without space and time
   limits. As a result, the offer of courses and the number of enrolled
   students has grown exponentially. In order to be able to guarantee
   students a better learning support service, one of the proposals regards
   the intelligent Chatbots. These well known interactive applications are
   based mainly on machine or deep learning and in this paper we present
   Boulez, a system allowing the orchestration of a community of individual
   chatbots, each one with its algorithm and its private training dataset.
   We apply a technique called Federated Learning, where several individual
   chatbots, collaborate. In particular, here the approach is
   ``centralized{''}, meaning that a main system orchestrates the
   collaboration of the federated systems. By addressing the communication
   inefficiencies and privacy issues of conventional federated learning,
   Boulez offers a more efficient and effective approach to chatbot
   interaction, ultimately leading to improved user experience. The paper
   presents the Boulez system, its operation principle, methods used, and
   potential benefits, along with a use case of its application.},

Abstract = {AI technology is being introduced into various public and private
   service domains, transforming existing computing systems or creating new
   ones. While AI technologies can provide benefits to humans and society,
   the unexpected consequences (e.g., malfunctions) of AI systems can cause
   social losses. For this reason, research on ethical design for the
   development of AI-based systems is becoming important. In this paper,
   from existing studies on AI ethics, general guidelines such as
   transparency, explainability, predictability, accountability, fairness,
   privacy, and control for the ethical design of AI systems are reviewed.
   And, based on the ethical design guidelines, we discuss ethical design
   to reduce the negative effects of biased data and unethical dialogues in
   AI-based conversational chatbots.},

Title = {Chatbot for construction firms using scalable blockchain network},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {141},
Month = {2022 SEP},
Abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), including multimedia
   tools, email services, voice-based tools, and handheld computing tools,
   have been extensively used for automating and digitalizing different
   construction processes and activities. However, these technologies are
   subjected to single-point attacks or failures, manipulation, and lack of
   privacy and traceability. This study introduces a novel information
   exchange and management system for construction firms based on
   blockchain technology and chatbots. The system leverages the
   characteristics of blockchain technology in terms of peer-to-peer
   operation mode, data integrity, structuring, and privacy, and the
   chatbots' merits regarding ease of use and degree of automation. The
   system is developed for tracking work progress in construction projects
   as a generic use-case using a four-step approach. First, a private
   blockchain network is configured for data distribution and storage.
   Second, a smart contract is coded for regulating data writing/reading
   operations. Third, a chatbot is developed for data collection and
   retrieval through textual conversations. Fourth, serverless cloud
   function and cloudant database are configured to allow the linkage
   between the blockchain network and the chatbot. A prototype of the
   system is built and applied to a case study of non-residential
   construction project to test and verify its capabilities. Further, the
   system's performance is assessed in terms of the writing and reading
   latencies and the storage size. The system features can be extended by
   embedding mathematical algorithms to simultaneously analyze data and
   employing Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) to maintain visuals and
   large-size data.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   Recognising the high numbers of unbanked and financially excluded adults
   in Nigeria, this study aims to position chatbot as a digital
   transformation tool to radically change business model, improve customer
   experience and enhance financial inclusion in emerging markets.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The Search-Access-Test (S-A-T) model was adopted to understand how
   Nigerian banks are adopting chatbots.
   Findings
   A majority of Nigerian banks now have chatbots that enhance customer
   engagement and financial inclusion. WhatsApp was the most frequently
   used platform. Chatbots were often branded and presented with female
   gender identification. The chatbots were less responsive beyond their
   predefined path. While Nigeria is a multilingual country with English
   being the original language, none of the chatbots used any of the
   Nigerian's local languages.
   Practical implications
   Brands need to re-evaluate their chatbots with regard to responsiveness,
   predefined questions, verification and privacy. There are also
   possibilities of branding the chatbot and developing content creation
   strategies for proper engagement. Beyond English, the integration of
   African languages into chatbot is essential for digital transformation.
   Digital literacy and skills, particularly in the field of science,
   technology, engineering and mathematics, should be supported to equip
   future developers and create more jobs.
   Originality/value
   While many theoretically based models for investigating the adoption of
   digital technologies have often placed focus on users' ability to
   engage, this study takes an alternative perspective; by using the S-A-T
   model, it lays the responsibilities on the banks and chatbot developer
   to ensure that their chatbots are secure, responsive and able to meet
   the needs of the customers.},

Title = {A Medical Ethics Framework for Conversational Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Month = {JUL 26},
Abstract = {The launch of OpenAI's GPT-3 model in June 2020 began a new era for
   conversational chatbots. While there are chatbots that do not use
   artificial intelligence (AI), conversational chatbots integrate AI
   language models that allow for back-and-forth conversation between an AI
   system and a human user. GPT-3, since upgraded to GPT-4, harnesses a
   natural language processing technique called sentence embedding and
   allows for conversations with users that are more nuanced and realistic
   than before. The launch of this model came in the first few months of
   the COVID-19 pandemic, where increases in health care needs globally
   combined with social distancing measures made virtual medicine more
   relevant than ever. GPT-3 and other conversational models have been used
   for a wide variety of medical purposes, from providing basic
   COVID-19-related guidelines to personalized medical advice and even
   prescriptions. The line between medical professionals and conversational
   chatbots is somewhat blurred, notably in hard-to-reach communities where
   the chatbot replaced face-to-face health care. Considering these blurred
   lines and the circumstances accelerating the adoption of conversational
   chatbots globally, we analyze the use of these tools from an ethical
   perspective. Notably, we map out the many types of risks in the use of
   conversational chatbots in medicine to the principles of medical ethics.
   In doing so, we propose a framework for better understanding the effects
   of these chatbots on both patients and the medical field more broadly,
   with the hope of informing safe and appropriate future developments.},

Title = {Thematic Analysis on User Reviews for Depression and Anxiety Chatbot
   Apps: Machine Learning Approach},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Anxiety and depression are among the most commonly prevalent
   mental health disorders worldwide. Chatbot apps can play an important
   role in relieving anxiety and depression. Users' reviews of chatbot apps
   are considered an important source of data for exploring users' opinions
   and satisfaction.
   Objective: This study aims to explore users' opinions, satisfaction, and
   attitudes toward anxiety and depression chatbot apps by conducting a
   thematic analysis of users' reviews of 11 anxiety and depression chatbot
   apps collected from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. In
   addition, we propose a workflow to provide a methodological approach for
   future analysis of app review comments.
   Methods: We analyzed 205,581 user review comments from chatbots designed
   for users with anxiety and depression symptoms. Using scraper tools and
   Google Play Scraper and App Store Scraper Python libraries, we extracted
   the text and metadata. The reviews were divided into positive and
   negative meta-themes based on users' rating per review. We analyzed the
   reviews using word frequencies of bigrams and words in pairs. A topic
   modeling technique, latent Dirichlet allocation, was applied to identify
   topics in the reviews and analyzed to detect themes and subthemes.
   Results: Thematic analysis was conducted on 5 topics for each
   sentimental set. Reviews were categorized as positive or negative. For
   positive reviews, the main themes were confidence and affirmation
   building, adequate analysis, and consultation, caring as a friend, and
   ease of use. For negative reviews, the results revealed the following
   themes: usability issues, update issues, privacy, and noncreative
   conversations.
   Conclusions: Using a machine learning approach, we were able to analyze
   >= 200,000 comments and categorize them into themes, allowing us to
   observe users' expectations effectively despite some negative factors. A
   methodological workflow is provided for the future analysis of review
   comments.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Thanks to the popularity of personal mobile devices, more and more of
   the different types of private content, such as images and videos, are
   shared on social networking applications. While content sharing may be
   an effective practice to enhance social relationships, it is also a
   source of relevant privacy issues. Unfortunately, users find it
   difficult to understanding the terms and implications of the privacy
   policies of apps and services. Moreover, taking privacy decisions about
   content sharing on social networks is cumbersome and prone to errors
   that could determine privacy leaks. In this paper, we propose two
   techniques aimed at supporting the user in taking privacy choices about
   sharing personal content online. Our techniques are based on machine
   learning and natural language processing to analyze privacy policies,
   and on computer vision to assist the user in the privacy-conscious
   sharing of multimedia content. Experiments with real-world data show the
   potential of our solutions. We also present ongoing work on a system
   prototype and chatbot for natural language user assistance.},

Abstract = {The temptation to be able to talk to a machine is not new. Recent
   advancements in the field of Natural Language Understanding has made it
   possible to build conversational components that can be plugged inside
   an application, similar to other components. These components, called
   chatbots, can be created from scratch or with the help of commercially
   available platforms. These platforms make it easier to build and deploy
   chatbots, often without writing a single line of code. However, similar
   to any other software component, chatbots also have quality concerns.
   Despite significant contributions in the field, an architectural
   perspective of building chatbots with desired quality requirements is
   missing in the literature.
   In the current work, we highlight the impact of features provided by
   these platforms (along with their quality) on the application design
   process and overall quality attributes. We propose a methodological
   framework to evaluate support provided by a chatbot platform towards
   achieving quality in the application. The framework, called Hospitality
   Framework, is based on software architectural body of knowledge,
   especially architectural tactics. The framework produces a metric,
   called Hospitality Index, which has utilities for making various design
   decisions for the overall application. We present the use of our
   framework on a simple use case to highlight the phases of evaluation. We
   showcase the process by picking three popular chatbot platforms - Watson
   Assistant, DialogFlow and Lex, over four quality attributes -
   Modifiability, Security \& Privacy, Interoperability and Reliability.
   Our results show that different platforms provide different support for
   these four quality attributes.},

   study aims to explore and enhance the acceptance of chatbots. The study
   considered functional, relational, social, user and gratification
   elements in determining the acceptance of chatbots.
   Design/methodology/approach By using the purposive sampling technique,
   data of 321 service customers, gathered from millennials through a
   questionnaire and subsequent PLS-SEM modeling, was applied for
   hypotheses testing. Findings Findings revealed that the functional
   elements, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use affect
   acceptance of chatbots. However, in social elements, only perceived
   social interactivity affects the acceptance of chatbots. Moreover, both
   user and gratification elements (hedonic motivation and symbolic
   motivation) significantly influence the acceptance of chatbots. Lastly,
   trust is the only contributing factor for the acceptance of chatbots in
   the relational elements. Practical implications The study extends the
   literature related to chatbots and offers several guidelines to the
   service industry to effectively employ chatbots. Originality/value This
   is one of the first studies that used newly developed sRAM in
   determining chatbot acceptance. Moreover, the study extended the sRAM by
   adding user and gratification elements and privacy concerns as
   originally sRAM model was limited to functional, relational and social
   elements.},

Title = {Conversational Physical Activity Coaches for Spanish and English
   Speaking Women: A User Design Study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {OCT 8},
Abstract = {Introduction: Digital technologies, including text messaging and mobile
   phone apps, can be leveraged to increase people's physical activity and
   manage health. Chatbots, powered by artificial intelligence, can
   automatically interact with individuals through natural conversation.
   They may be more engaging than one-way messaging interventions. To our
   knowledge, physical activity chatbots have not been developed with
   low-income participants, nor in Spanish-the second most dominant
   language in the U.S. We recommend best practices for physical activity
   chatbots in English and Spanish for low-income women.Methods: We
   designed a prototype physical activity text-message based conversational
   agent based on various psychotherapeutic techniques. We recruited
   participants through SNAP-Ed (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
   Education) in California (Alameda County) and Tennessee (Shelby County).
   We conducted qualitative interviews with participants during testing of
   our prototype chatbot, held a Wizard of Oz study, and facilitated a
   co-design workshop in Spanish with a subset of our participants.Results:
   We included 10 Spanish- and 8 English-speaking women between 27 and 41
   years old. The majority was Hispanic/Latina (n = 14), 2 were White and 2
   were Black/African American. More than half were monolingual Spanish
   speakers, and the majority was born outside the US (>50\% in Mexico).
   Most participants were unfamiliar with chatbots and were initially
   skeptical. After testing our prototype, most users felt positively about
   health chatbots. They desired a personalized chatbot that addresses
   their concerns about privacy, and stressed the need for a comprehensive
   system to also aid with nutrition, health information, stress, and
   involve family members. Differences between English and monolingual
   Spanish speakers were found mostly in exercise app use, digital
   literacy, and the wish for family inclusion.Conclusion: Low-income
   Spanish- and English-speaking women are interested in using chatbots to
   improve their physical activity and other health related aspects.
   Researchers developing health chatbots for this population should focus
   on issues of digital literacy, app familiarity, linguistic and cultural
   issues, privacy concerns, and personalization. Designing and testing
   this intervention for and with this group using co-creation techniques
   and involving community partners will increase the probability that it
   will ultimately be effective.},

Abstract = {Conversational interfaces have risen in popularity as businesses and
   users adopt a range of conversational agents, including chatbots and
   voice assistants. Although guidelines have been proposed, there is not
   yet an established set of usability heuristics to guide and evaluate
   conversational agent design. In this paper, we propose a set of
   heuristics for conversational agents adapted from Nielsen's heuristics
   and based on expert feedback. We then validate the heuristics through
   two rounds of evaluations conducted by participants on two
   conversational agents, one chatbot and one voice-based personal
   assistant. We find that, when using our heuristics to evaluate both
   interfaces, evaluators were able to identify more usability issues than
   when using Nielsen's heuristics. We propose that our heuristics
   successfully identify issues related to dialogue content, interaction
   design, help and guidance, human-like characteristics, and data privacy.},

Title = {Utilization of Self-Diagnosis Health Chatbots in Real-World Settings:
   Case Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 6},
Abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven chatbots are
   increasingly being used in health care, but most chatbots are designed
   for a specific population and evaluated in controlled settings. There is
   little research documenting how health consumers (eg, patients and
   caregivers) use chatbots for self-diagnosis purposes in real-world
   scenarios.
   Objective: The aim of this research was to understand how health
   chatbots are used in a real-world context, what issues and barriers
   exist in their usage, and how the user experience of this novel
   technology can be improved.
   Methods: We employed a data-driven approach to analyze the system log of
   a widely deployed self-diagnosis chatbot in China. Our data set
   consisted of 47,684 consultation sessions initiated by 16,519 users over
   6 months. The log data included a variety of information, including
   users' nonidentifiable demographic information, consultation details,
   diagnostic reports, and user feedback. We conducted both statistical
   analysis and content analysis on this heterogeneous data set.
   Results: The chatbot users spanned all age groups, including middle-aged
   and older adults. Users consulted the chatbot on a wide range of medical
   conditions, including those that often entail considerable privacy and
   social stigma issues. Furthermore, we distilled 2 prominent issues in
   the use of the chatbot: (1) a considerable number of users dropped out
   in the middle of their consultation sessions, and (2) some users
   pretended to have health concerns and used the chatbot for
   nontherapeutic purposes. Finally, we identified a set of user concerns
   regarding the use of the chatbot, including insufficient actionable
   information and perceived inaccurate diagnostic suggestions.
   Conclusions: Although health chatbots are considered to be convenient
   tools for enhancing patient-centered care, there are issues and barriers
   impeding the optimal use of this novel technology. Designers and
   developers should employ user-centered approaches to address the issues
   and user concerns to achieve the best uptake and utilization. We
   conclude the paper by discussing several design implications, including
   making the chatbots more informative, easy-to-use, and trustworthy, as
   well as improving the onboarding experience to enhance user engagement.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study serves two purposes: (1) to evaluate the effects of
   organizational ambidexterity by examining how the balanced and the
   combined sales-service configurations of chatbots differ in their
   abilities to enhance customer experience and patronage and (2) to apply
   information boundary theory to assess the contingent role that chatbot
   sales-service ambidexterity can play in adapting to customers'
   personalization-privacy paradox. Design/methodology/approach An online
   survey of artificial intelligence chatbots users was conducted, and a
   mixed-methods research design involving response surface analysis and
   polynomial regression was adopted to address the research aim. Findings
   The results of polynomial regressions on survey data from 507 online
   customers indicated that as the benefits of personalization decreased
   and the risk to privacy increased, the inherently negative (positive)
   effects of imbalanced (combined) chatbots' sales-service ambidexterity
   had an increasing (decreasing) influence on customer experience.
   Furthermore, customer experience fully mediated the association of
   chatbots' sales-service ambidexterity with customer patronage.
   Originality/value First, this study enriches the literature on frontline
   ambidexterity and extends it to the setting of human-machine
   interaction. Second, the study contributes to the literature on the
   personalization-privacy paradox by demonstrating the importance of
   frontline ambidexterity for adapting to customer concerns. Third, the
   study examines the conduit between artificial intelligence (AI)
   chatbots' ambidexterity and sales performance, thereby helping to
   reconcile the previously inconsistent evidence regarding this
   relationship.},

Abstract = {The EngageAI Institute focuses on AI-driven narrative-centered learning
   environments that create engaging story-based problem-solving
   experiences to support collaborative learning. The institute's research
   has three complementary strands. First, the institute creates
   narrative-centered learning environments that generate interactive
   story-based problem scenarios to elicit rich communication, encourage
   coordination, and spark collaborative creativity. Second, the institute
   creates virtual embodied conversational agent technologies with multiple
   modalities for communication (speech, facial expression, gesture, gaze,
   and posture) to support student learning. Embodied conversational agents
   are driven by advances in natural language understanding, natural
   language generation, and computer vision. Third, the institute is
   creating an innovative multimodal learning analytics framework that
   analyzes parallel streams of multimodal data derived from students'
   conversations, gaze, facial expressions, gesture, and posture as they
   interact with each other, with teachers, and with embodied
   conversational agents. Woven throughout the institute's activities is a
   strong focus on ethics, with an emphasis on creating AI-augmented
   learning that is deeply informed by considerations of fairness,
   accountability, transparency, trust, and privacy. The institute
   emphasizes broad participation and diverse perspectives to ensure that
   advances in AI-augmented learning address inequities in STEM. The
   institute brings together a multistate network of universities, diverse
   K-12 school systems, science museums, and nonprofit partners. Key to all
   of these endeavors is an emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion.},

Title = {Health-focused conversational agents in person-centered care: a review
   of apps},
Journal = {NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},

Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {Health-focused apps with chatbots ({''}healthbots{''}) have a critical
   role in addressing gaps in quality healthcare. There is limited evidence
   on how such healthbots are developed and applied in practice. Our review
   of healthbots aims to classify types of healthbots, contexts of use, and
   their natural language processing capabilities. Eligible apps were those
   that were health-related, had an embedded text-based conversational
   agent, available in English, and were available for free download
   through the Google Play or Apple iOS store. Apps were identified using
   42Matters software, a mobile app search engine. Apps were assessed using
   an evaluation framework addressing chatbot characteristics and natural
   language processing features. The review suggests uptake across 33 low-
   and high-income countries. Most healthbots are patient-facing, available
   on a mobile interface and provide a range of functions including health
   education and counselling support, assessment of symptoms, and
   assistance with tasks such as scheduling. Most of the 78 apps reviewed
   focus on primary care and mental health, only 6 (7.59\%) had a
   theoretical underpinning, and 10 (12.35\%) complied with health
   information privacy regulations. Our assessment indicated that only a
   few apps use machine learning and natural language processing
   approaches, despite such marketing claims. Most apps allowed for a
   finite-state input, where the dialogue is led by the system and follows
   a predetermined algorithm. Healthbots are potentially transformative in
   centering care around the user; however, they are in a nascent state of
   development and require further research on development, automation and
   adoption for a population-level health impact.},

Title = {Smart Speakers: The Next Frontier in mHealth},
Journal = {JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The rapid dissemination and adoption of smart speakers has enabled
   substantial opportunities to improve human health. Just as the
   introduction of the mobile phone led to considerable health innovation,
   smart speaker computing systems carry several unique advantages that
   have the potential to catalyze new fields of health research,
   particularly in out-of-hospital environments. The recent rise and
   ubiquity of these smart computing systems holds significant potential
   for enhancing chronic disease management, enabling passive
   identification of unwitnessed medical emergencies, detecting subtle
   changes in human behavior and cognition, limiting isolation, and
   potentially allowing widespread, passive, remote monitoring of
   respiratory diseases that impact public health. There are 3 broad
   mechanisms for how a smart speaker can interact with a person to improve
   health. These include (1) as an intelligent conversational agent, (2) as
   a passive identifier of medically relevant diagnostic sounds, and (3) by
   active sensing using the device's internal hardware to measure
   physiologic parameters, such as with active sonar, radar, or computer
   vision. Each of these different modalities has specific clinical use
   cases, all of which need to be balanced against potential privacy
   concerns, equity concerns related to system access, and regulatory
   frameworks which have not yet been developed for this unique type of
   passive data collection.},

Abstract = {An enhanced understanding of the innovative use of artificial
   intelligence (AI) is essential for organizations to improve work design
   and daily business operations. This study's purpose is to offer insights
   into how AI can transform organizations' work practices through diving
   deeply into its innovative use in the context of a primary AI tool, a
   chatbot, and examining the antecedents of innovative use by
   conceptualizing employee trust as a multidimensional construct and
   exploring employees' perceived benefits. In particular, we have
   conceptualized employee trust in chatbots as a second-order construct,
   including three first-order variables: trust in functionality, trust in
   reliability, and trust in data protection. We collected data from 202
   employees. The results supported our conceptualization of trust in
   chatbots and showed that three dimensions of first-order trust beliefs
   have relatively the same level of importance. Further, both knowledge
   support and work-life balance enhance trust in chatbots, which in turn
   leads to innovative use of chatbots. Our study contributes to the
   existing literature by introducing the new conceptualization of trust in
   chatbots and examining its antecedents and outcomes. The results can
   provide important practical insights regarding how to support innovative
   use of chatbots as the new way we organize work.},

Title = {Evaluation of the Current State of Chatbots for Digital Health: Scoping
   Review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Month = {DEC 19},
Abstract = {Background: Chatbots have become ubiquitous in our daily lives, enabling
   natural language conversations with users through various modes of
   communication. Chatbots have the potential to play a significant role in
   promoting health and well-being. As the number of studies and available
   products related to chatbots continues to rise, there is a critical need
   to assess product features to enhance the design of chatbots that
   effectively promote health and behavioral change. Objective: This
   scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the current
   state of health-related chatbots, including the chatbots'
   characteristics and features, user backgrounds, communication models,
   relational building capacity, personalization, interaction, responses to
   suicidal thoughts, and users' in-app experiences during chatbot use.
   Through this analysis, we seek to identify gaps in the current research,
   guide future directions, and enhance the design of health-focused
   chatbots. Methods: Following the scoping review methodology by Arksey
   and O'Malley and guided by the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for
   Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews)
   checklist, this study used a two-pronged approach to identify relevant
   chatbots: (1) searching the iOS and Android App Stores and (2) reviewing
   scientific literature through a search strategy designed by a librarian.
   Overall, 36 chatbots were selected based on predefined criteria from
   both sources. These chatbots were systematically evaluated using a
   comprehensive framework developed for this study, including chatbot
   characteristics, user backgrounds, building relational capacity,
   personalization, interaction models, responses to critical situations,
   and user experiences. Ten coauthors were responsible for downloading and
   testing the chatbots, coding their features, and evaluating their
   performance in simulated conversations. The testing of all chatbot apps
   was limited to their free-to-use features. Results: This review provides
   an overview of the diversity of health-related chatbots, encompassing
   categories such as mental health support, physical activity promotion,
   and behavior change interventions. Chatbots use text, animations,
   speech, images, and emojis for communication. The findings highlight
   variations in conversational capabilities, including empathy, humor, and
   personalization. Notably, concerns regarding safety, particularly in
   addressing suicidal thoughts, were evident. Approximately 44\% (16/36)
   of the chatbots effectively addressed suicidal thoughts. User
   experiences and behavioral outcomes demonstrated the potential of
   chatbots in health interventions, but evidence remains limited.
   Conclusions: This scoping review underscores the significance of
   chatbots in health-related applications and offers insights into their
   features, functionalities, and user experiences. This study contributes
   to advancing the understanding of chatbots' role in digital health
   interventions, thus paving the way for more effective and user-centric
   health promotion strategies. This study informs future research
   directions, emphasizing the need for rigorous randomized control trials,
   standardized evaluation metrics, and user-centered design to unlock the
   full potential of chatbots in enhancing health and well-being. Future
   research should focus on addressing limitations, exploring real-world
   user experiences, and implementing robust data security and privacy
   measures.},

Title = {The Use of Artificial Intelligence-Based Conversational Agents
   (Chatbots) for Weight Loss: Scoping Review and Practical Recommendations},
Journal = {JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {4-17},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Overweight and obesity have now reached a state of a
   pandemic despite the clinical and commercial programs available.
   Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have a strong potential in
   optimizing such programs for weight loss.
   Objective: This study aimed to review AI chatbot use cases for weight
   loss and to identify the essential components for prolonging user
   engagement.
   Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the 5-stage framework by
   Arksey and O'Malley. Articles were searched across nine electronic
   databases (ACM Digital Library, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, IEEE
   Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) until July 9,
   2021. Gray literature, reference lists, and Google Scholar were also
   searched.
   Results: A total of 23 studies with 2231 participants were included and
   evaluated in this review. Most studies (8/23, 35\%) focused on using AI
   chatbots to promote both a healthy diet and exercise, 13\% (3/23) of the
   studies used AI chatbots solely for lifestyle data collection and
   obesity risk assessment whereas only 4\% (1/23) of the studies focused
   on promoting a combination of a healthy diet, exercise, and stress
   management. In total, 48\% (11/23) of the studies used only text-based
   AI chatbots, 52\% (12/23) operationalized AI chatbots through
   smartphones, and 39\% (9/23) integrated data collected through fitness
   wearables or Internet of Things appliances. The core functions of AI
   chatbots were to provide personalized recommendations (20/23, 87\%),
   motivational messages (18/23, 78\%), gamification (6/23, 26\%), and
   emotional support (6/23, 26\%). Study participants who experienced
   speech- and augmented reality based chatbot interactions in addition to
   text based chatbot interactions reported higher user engagement because
   of the convenience of hands-free interactions. Enabling conversations
   through multiple platforms (eg, SMS text messaging, Slack, Telegram,
   Signal, WhatsApp, or Facebook Messenger) and devices (eg, laptops,
   Google Home, and Amazon Alexa) was reported to increase user engagement.
   The human semblance of chatbots through verbal and nonverbal cues
   improved user engagement through interactivity and empathy. Other
   techniques used in text-based chatbots included personally and
   culturally appropriate colloquial tones and content; emojis that emulate
   human emotional expressions; positively framed words; citations of
   credible information sources; personification; validation; and the
   provision of real-time, fast, and reliable recommendations. Prevailing
   issues included privacy; accountability; user burden; and
   interoperability with other databases, third-party applications, social
   media platforms, devices, and appliances.
   Conclusions: AI chatbots should be designed to be human-like,
   personalized, contextualized, immersive, and enjoyable to enhance user
   experience, engagement, behavior change, and weight loss. These require
   the integration of health metrics (eg, based on self-reports and
   wearable trackers), personality and preferences (eg, based on goal
   achievements), circumstantial behaviors (eg, trigger-based
   overconsumption), and emotional states (eg, chatbot conversations and
   wearable stress detectors) to deliver personalized and effective
   recommendations for weight loss.},

Abstract = {Early conversational agents (CAs) focused on dyadic human-AI interaction
   between humans and the CAs, followed by the increasing popularity of
   polyadic human-AI interaction, in which CAs are designed to mediate
   human-human interactions. CAs for polyadic interactions are unique
   because they encompass hybrid social interactions, i.e., human-CA,
   human-to-human, and human-to-group behaviors. However, research on
   polyadic CAs is scattered across diferent felds, making it challenging
   to identify, compare, and accumulate existing knowledge. To promote the
   future design of CA systems, we conducted a literature review of ACM
   publications and identifed a set of works that conducted UX (user
   experience) research. We qualitatively synthesized the efects of
   polyadic CAs into four aspects of human-human interactions, i.e.,
   communication, engagement, connection, and relationship maintenance.
   Through a mixed-method analysis of the selected polyadic and dyadic CA
   studies, we developed a suite of evaluation measurements on the efects.
   Our fndings show that designing with social boundaries, such as privacy,
   disclosure, and identifcation, is crucial for ethical polyadic CAs.
   Future research should also advance usability testing methods and
   trust-building guidelines for conversational AI.},

Abstract = {So far, we have proposed the Stress management framework and developed
   methods for stress measurement and coping. There are three types of
   coping in this framework: information support, emotional support, and
   esteem support. This time, we developed esteem support. In order to
   increase self-esteem, we focused on psychodrama techniques and developed
   a system to realize psychodrama using robots. The advantages of using
   robots include the ability to carry out a psychodrama alone and to
   provide privacy-friendly support. In the experiment, a scenario was
   created for medical staff and a robot psychodrama was performed. As a
   result, we showed that robots can be used for psychodrama and esteem
   support can be carried out by combination of robots and the chatbot.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots like ChatGPT and Google Bard are
   computer programs that use AI and natural language processing to
   understand customer questions and generate natural, fluid, dialogue-like
   responses to their inputs. ChatGPT, an AI chatbot created by OpenAI, has
   rapidly become a widely used tool on the internet. AI chatbots have the
   potential to improve patient care and public health. However, they are
   trained on massive amounts of people's data, which may include sensitive
   patient data and business information. The increased use of chatbots
   introduces data security issues, which should be handled yet remain
   understudied. This paper aims to identify the most important security
   problems of AI chatbots and propose guidelines for protecting sensitive
   health information. It explores the impact of using ChatGPT in health
   care. It also identifies the principal security risks of ChatGPT and
   suggests key considerations for security risk mitigation. It concludes
   by discussing the policy implications of using AI chatbots in health
   care.},

Abstract = {Introduction: The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has
   presented several opportunities to ease human work. AI applications are
   available for almost every domain of life. A new technology, Chat
   Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), was introduced by OpenAI
   in November 2022, and has become a topic of discussion across the world.
   ChatGPT-3 has brought many opportunities, as well as ethical and privacy
   considerations. ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM) which has been
   trained on the events that happened until 2021. The use of AI and its
   assisted technologies in scientific writing is against research and
   publication ethics. Therefore, policies and guidelines need to be
   developed over the use of such tools in scientific writing. The main
   objective of the present study was to highlight the use of AI and AI
   assisted technologies such as the ChatGPT and other chatbots in the
   scientific writing and in the research domain resulting in bias, spread
   of inaccurate information and plagiarism. Methodology: Experiments were
   designed to test the accuracy of ChatGPT when used in research and
   academic writing. Results: The information provided by ChatGPT was
   inaccurate and may have far-reaching implications in the field of
   medical science and engineering. Critical thinking should be encouraged
   among researchers to raise awareness about the associated privacy and
   ethical risks. Conclusions: Regulations for ethical and privacy concerns
   related to the use of ChatGPT in academics and research need to be
   developed.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence is transforming the way chatbots are created and
   used. The recent boom of artificial intelligence development is creating
   a whole new generation of intelligent approaches that enable a more
   efficient and effective design of chatbots. On the other hand, the
   increasing need and interest from the industry in artificial
   intelligence based solutions, is guaranteeing the necessary investment
   and applicational know-how that is pushing such solutions to a new
   dimension. Some relevant examples are e-commerce, health or education,
   which is the main focus of this work. This paper studies and analyses
   the impact that artificial intelligence models and solutions is having
   on the design and development of chatbots, when compared to the
   previously used approaches. Some of the most relevant current and future
   challenges in this domain are highlighted, which include language
   learning, sentiment interpretation, integration with other services, or
   data security and privacy issues.},

Month = {2023 NOV},
Abstract = {In less than one year from its launch, the chatbot ChatGPT has captured
   widespread public attention, thanks to its ease of use and remarkable
   performance. However, part of this interest is due to its involvement in
   some data protection and data security issues. In the context of the
   ongoing debate surrounding similar technologies, such as generative AI,
   this contribution will first introduce the ``ChatGPT phenomenon{''}
   (Sections 1 and 2). Then, it will analyse the various positions taken by
   some key stakeholders on the issues of above and the regulation of the
   design and use of such technologies, examining these perspectives
   through the lenses of ``Digital Constitutionalism{''}. Particularly,
   this paper will emphasise the role that civil society can play in such
   dynamics (Section 3). Subsequently, it will further promote an active
   and forward-looking approach in addressing the looming threats these and
   other AI-based technologies could pose to fundamental rights and society
   as a whole (Section 4). As we already approach the next AI era without
   even noticing, the question worth asking ourselves is: ``What will
   generative and AI-powered oracles reveal about us?{''} (Section 5).},

Abstract = {There is a paradigm shift in web-based services towards conversational
   user interfaces. Companies increasingly offer conversational interfaces,
   or chatbots, to let their customers or employees interact with their
   services in a more flexible and mobile manner. Unfortunately, this new
   paradigm faces a major problem, namely toxic content in user inputs.
   Toxic content in user inputs to chatbots may cause privacy concerns, may
   be adversarial or malicious, and can cause the chatbot provider
   substantial economic, reputational, or legal harm. We address this
   problem with an interdisciplinary approach, drawing upon programming
   languages, cloud computing, and other disciplines to build protections
   for chatbots. Our solution, called BotShield, is non-intrusive in that
   it does not require changes to existing chatbots or underlying
   conversational platforms. This paper introduces novel security
   mechanisms, articulates their security guarantees, and illustrates them
   via case studies.},

Title = {Can chatbots satisfy me? A mixed-method comparative study of
   satisfaction with task-oriented chatbots in mainland China and Hong Kong},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {143},
Month = {2023 JUN},
Abstract = {Task-oriented chatbots are gradually being used across the globe. Most
   notably, while chatbots have for a long time penetrated users' daily
   lives in mainland China, Hong Kong is still struggling to improve and
   promote its chatbot services. To determine whether antecedents of
   satisfaction and usage intention differ based on different stages of
   chatbot adoption and development, we conduct a comparative study based
   on a research model that integrates the Delone and McLean Information
   System success model and privacy concerns. The model is developed and
   examined using a mixed-method approach. After conducting focus group
   interviews (N = 15) in both regions, online surveys were conducted in
   mainland China (N = 637) and Hong Kong (N = 647), respec-tively. Based
   on qualitative exploration, we identified critical factors of perceived
   quality and privacy concerns. The quantitative findings further
   illuminate the different roles of the antecedents in the two regions.
   The results show that usage intention can be positively influenced by
   satisfaction, and satisfaction can be increased by relevance,
   completeness, pleasure and assurance in both regions. However, response
   time and empathy are factors influencing satisfaction only in mainland
   China. Privacy concerns cannot influence satisfaction in both regions.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, the use of chatbots for educational purposes has
   gained considerable traction. A similar trend has been observed in
   social coding platforms, where automated agents support software
   developers with tasks such as performing code reviews. While
   incorporating code reviews and social coding platforms into software
   engineering education has been found to be beneficial, challenges such
   as steep learning curves and privacy considerations are barriers to
   their adoption. Furthermore, no study has addressed the role chatbots
   play in supporting code reviews as a pedagogical tool. To help address
   this gap, we developed an online learning application that simulates the
   code review features available on social coding platforms and allows
   instructors to interact with students using chatbot identities. We then
   embedded this application within a lesson on software engineering best
   practices and conducted a controlled in-class experiment. This
   experiment examined the effect that explaining content via chatbot
   identities had on three aspects: (i) students' perceived usability of
   the lesson, (ii) their engagement with the code review process, and
   (iii) their learning gains. While our findings show that it is feasible
   to simulate the code review process within an online learning platform
   and achieve good usability, our quantitative analysis did not yield
   significant differences across treatment conditions for any of the
   aspects considered. Nevertheless, our qualitative results suggest that
   students expect explicit feedback when performing this type of exercise
   and could thus benefit from automated replies provided by an interactive
   chatbot. We propose to build on our current findings to further explore
   this line of research in future work.},

Abstract = {The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is enhancing the services and applications
   in government organizations through the number of systems that generate
   a massive amount of data through Big Data technology. Recently, the
   Global Artificial Intelligent Summit 2020, Saudi Data and Artificial
   Intelligence Authority (SDAIA), NEOM have launched an Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) strategy that aligns with the Kingdom Vision 2030. AI
   opens a wide door for opportunities and new strategies that will narrow
   the gap in the skillset of individuals and promote research and
   innovation in the IT industry. Organizations lack advanced techniques to
   evaluate the performance of individuals and departments that supports
   improving the quality of service. The introduction of AI-based
   applications in the government and private sectors will facilitate
   decision-makers in tracking and optimizing the efficiency of departments
   and individuals. This research aims to develop an intelligent framework
   for government organizations to improve the quality of services rendered
   to customers and businesses. In addition, it highlights the importance
   of AI policies in archiving metadata. This paper presents a framework
   for an organization that contains Chatbot, Sentiment Analysis, and Key
   Performance Indicators to improve the services. A synthetic dataset is
   employed as a testbed to evaluate the performance of the framework. The
   outcome of this study shows that the proposed framework able to improve
   the performance of organizations. Using this proposed framework,
   organizations can build a mechanism for their workforce to retrieve
   meaningful information. Moreover, it provides significant features
   include efficient data extraction, data management, and AI-based
   security for effective document management.},

Title = {From web forms to chatbots: The roles of consistency and reciprocity for
   user information disclosure},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 28},
Abstract = {Interactive decision aids (IDAs) on websites often require users to
   disclose relevant information (e.g., preferences, contact information)
   to help users in making decisions (e.g., product choice). With
   technological advances in IDAs, websites increasingly switch from
   static, non-conversational IDAs (e.g., web forms) to conversational ones
   (e.g., chatbots) to boost user information disclosure that nurtures the
   websites' economic viability. While this novel form of IDAs is already
   widely employed in practice, information systems research has yet to
   examine the defining dialogue design features of conversational IDAs and
   their effects on eliciting user information. Drawing on persuasion
   theory and particularly on consistency and reciprocity as influence
   techniques, we develop a research model around two crucial dialogue
   design features of conversational IDAs. Specifically, we investigate the
   distinct and joint effects of conversational style (i.e., absence vs.
   presence of a conversational presentation of requests) and reciprocation
   triggers (i.e., absence vs. presence of reciprocity-inducing
   information) on user information disclosure (i.e., email addresses). By
   combining the complementary properties of a randomised field experiment
   (N = 386) and a follow-up online experiment (N = 182), we empirically
   provide evidence in support of the distinct and joint effects of
   conversational style and reciprocation triggers of IDAs on user
   information disclosure. Moreover, we demonstrate that these dialogue
   design features have indirect effects on information disclosure via
   perceptions of social presence and privacy concerns. Thus, our paper
   provides theoretical and practical insights into whether, how, and why
   critical IDA dialogue design features can better elicit user information
   for website services.},

Title = {?So what if ChatGPT wrote it?? Multidisciplinary perspectives on
   opportunities, challenges and implications of generative conversational
   AI for research, practice and policy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {71},
Month = {2023 AUG},
Abstract = {Transformative artificially intelligent tools, such as ChatGPT, designed
   to generate sophisticated text indistin-guishable from that produced by
   a human, are applicable across a wide range of contexts. The technology
   presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges,
   and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for
   organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary
   insight into some of these, this article brings together 43
   contributions from experts in fields such as computer science,
   marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and
   tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors
   acknowledge ChatGPT's capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest
   that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality
   and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business
   activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also
   consider its limitations, dis-ruptions to practices, threats to privacy
   and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation.
   However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT's use should be restricted
   or legislated. Drawing on these con-tributions, the article identifies
   questions requiring further research across three thematic areas:
   knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of
   organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly
   research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills,
   resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining
   biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes;
   exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI
   implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative
   AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text
   produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues
   in using generative AI across different contexts.},

Abstract = {Internationally, evidence exists that physicians use instant messaging
   services for communication tasks in everyday clinical practice However,
   there are only few data on physicians in Germany in this regard.
   Therefore, at the initiation of our project ``DocTalk-Dialog meets
   Chatbot: Collaborative Learning and Teaching in the Process of Work{''},
   we conducted a stakeholder survey with an exploratory research approach.
   The aim was to gain initial insights into use of instant messaging
   software and attitudes towards data security and advantages and
   disadvantages before implementing a data-secure in-house messaging
   platform. N = 70 physicians at Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin
   completed an exploratory questionnaire with closed and open-ended
   questions. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics
   and qualitative data using thematic analysis. The use of messenger
   software was not widespread in the sample studied. Physicians most
   frequently used face-to-face contact for communication. On average, up
   to ten instant messages were exchanged per day, mainly among colleagues,
   to answer mutual questions, and to send pictures. With a high awareness
   of privacy-related restrictions among participating physicians,
   advantages such as fast and uncomplicated communication were also
   highlighted. An instant messenger solution that complies with the German
   data protection guidelines is needed and should be investigated in more
   detail.},

Abstract = {The uses and gratifications approach is used to examine chatbot
   acceptance in coworking spaces, identifying how coworkers perceive the
   technology and may use it to facilitate their tasks. To do so, potential
   influence factors shaping technology acceptance are explored, and a
   sample of 101 German coworkers is employed to confirm the framework
   drawing on a quantitative combination of partial least squares
   structural equation modeling and necessary condition analysis.
   Instrumental and non-instrumental gratifications, as well as social
   norm, influence chatbot acceptance in the form of sufficient and
   necessary conditions, and social norm appears to have a more substantial
   impact than hedonic factors in terms of sufficiency. However, social
   norm is not a necessary condition. A moderator analysis reveals that
   privacy concerns, age and gender do not affect individuals' intention to
   use a chatbot. Coworking space providers thus benefit from establishing
   a standard chatbot solution to leverage social norm, and the chosen
   solution needs to fulfill hedonic expectations in addition to being
   useful. Software vendors may also integrate dedicated interfaces to
   powerful solutions such as ChatGPT.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {212-229},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {More and more companies have implemented chatbots on their websites to
   provide support to their visitors on a 24/7 basis. The new customer
   wants to spend less and less time and therefore expects to reach a
   company anytime and anywhere, regardless of time, location, and channel.
   This study provides insight into the influence of chatbots on customer
   loyalty. System quality, service quality, and information quality are
   crucial dimensions that a chatbot must meet to give a good customer
   experience. To make a chatbot more personal, companies can alter the
   language style. Human-like chatbots lead to greater satisfaction and
   trust among customers, leading to greater adoption of the chatbot. The
   results of this study showed that a connection between chatbots and
   customer loyalty is very likely. Besides, some customers suffer from the
   privacy paradox because of personalization. Implications of this study
   are discussed.},

   functional use and relational use of AI voice assistants},
Journal = {NEW MEDIA \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUL 15},
Abstract = {This study integrates two lines of research: technologies as tools and
   technologies as social beings, under the theoretical framework of
   dynamic systems, to investigate the reciprocal dynamics between
   functional use and relational use of artificial intelligence (AI) voice
   assistants, and the mediating roles of self-disclosure and privacy
   concerns. A two-wave longitudinal survey was conducted among 354 AI
   voice assistant users across 2 months. Factor analysis results supported
   the conceptualization and operationalization of functional use and
   relational use of voice assistants. Results from the cross-lagged panel
   model confirmed that functional use and relational use reinforced
   themselves over time, respectively. Relational use increased subsequent
   functional use, and relational use reinforced itself through
   self-disclosure. Surprisingly, functional use did not increase
   subsequent relational use; instead, longitudinal mediation analysis
   showed that functional use reduced subsequent relational use due to the
   lack of self-disclosure. Furthermore, while self-disclosure increased
   subsequent privacy concerns, privacy concerns did not reduce subsequent
   self-disclosure.},

Title = {Formative Evaluation of the Acceptance of HIV Prevention Artificial
   Intelligence Chatbots By Men Who Have Sex With Men in Malaysia: Focus
   Group Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Mobile technologies are being increasingly developed to
   support the practice of medicine, nursing, and public health, including
   HIV testing and prevention. Chatbots using artificial intelligence (AI)
   are novel mobile health strategies that can promote HIV testing and
   prevention among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Malaysia, a
   hard-to-reach population at elevated risk of HIV, yet little is known
   about the features that are important to this key population.Objective:
   The aim of this study was to identify the barriers to and facilitators
   of Malaysian MSM's acceptance of an AI chatbot designed to assist in HIV
   testing and prevention in relation to its perceived benefits,
   limitations, and preferred features among potential users.Methods: We
   conducted 5 structured web-based focus group interviews with 31 MSM in
   Malaysia between July 2021 and September 2021. The interviews were first
   recorded, transcribed, coded, and thematically analyzed using NVivo
   (version 9; QSR International). Subsequently, the unified theory of
   acceptance and use of technology was used to guide data analysis to map
   emerging themes related to the barriers to and facilitators of chatbot
   acceptance onto its 4 domains: performance expectancy, effort
   expectancy, facilitating conditions, and social influence.Results:
   Multiple barriers and facilitators influencing MSM's acceptance of an AI
   chatbot were identified for each domain. Performance expectancy (ie, the
   perceived usefulness of the AI chatbot) was influenced by MSM's concerns
   about the AI chatbot's ability to deliver accurate information, its
   effectiveness in information dissemination and problem-solving, and its
   ability to provide emotional support and raise health awareness.
   Convenience, cost, and technical errors influenced the AI chatbot's
   effort expectancy (ie, the perceived ease of use). Efficient linkage to
   health care professionals and HIV self-testing was reported as a
   facilitating condition of MSM's receptiveness to using an AI chatbot to
   access HIV testing. Participants stated that social influence (ie,
   sociopolitical climate) factors influencing the acceptance of mobile
   technology that addressed HIV in Malaysia included privacy concerns,
   pervasive stigma against homosexuality, and the criminalization of
   same-sex sexual behaviors. Key design strategies that could enhance
   MSM's acceptance of an HIV prevention AI chatbot included an anonymous
   user setting; embedding the chatbot in MSM-friendly web-based platforms;
   and providing user-guiding questions and options related to HIV testing,
   prevention, and treatment.Conclusions: This study provides important
   insights into key features and potential implementation strategies
   central to designing an AI chatbot as a culturally sensitive digital
   health tool to prevent stigmatized health conditions in vulnerable and
   systematically marginalized populations. Such features not only are
   crucial to designing effective user-centered and culturally situated
   mobile health interventions for MSM in Malaysia but also illuminate the
   importance of incorporating social stigma considerations into health
   technology implementation strategies.},

Abstract = {Introduction This study explores the effects of Artificial Intelligence
   (AI) chatbots, with a particular focus on OpenAI's ChatGPT, on Higher
   Education Institutions (HEIs). With the rapid advancement of AI,
   understanding its implications in the educational sector becomes
   paramount.Methods Utilizing databases like PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and
   Google Scholar, we systematically searched for literature on AI
   chatbots' impact on HEIs. Our criteria prioritized peer-reviewed
   articles, prominent media outlets, and English publications, excluding
   tangential AI chatbot mentions. After selection, data extraction focused
   on authors, study design, and primary findings. The analysis combined
   descriptive and thematic approaches, emphasizing patterns and
   applications of AI chatbots in HEIs.Results The literature review
   revealed diverse perspectives on ChatGPT's potential in education.
   Notable benefits include research support, automated grading, and
   enhanced human-computer interaction. However, concerns such as online
   testing security, plagiarism, and broader societal and economic impacts
   like job displacement, the digital literacy gap, and AI-induced anxiety
   were identified. The study also underscored the transformative
   architecture of ChatGPT and its versatile applications in the
   educational sector. Furthermore, potential advantages like streamlined
   enrollment, improved student services, teaching enhancements, research
   aid, and increased student retention were highlighted. Conversely, risks
   such as privacy breaches, misuse, bias, misinformation, decreased human
   interaction, and accessibility issues were identified.Discussion While
   AI's global expansion is undeniable, there is a pressing need for
   balanced regulation in its application within HEIs. Faculty members are
   encouraged to utilize AI tools like ChatGPT proactively and ethically to
   mitigate risks, especially academic fraud. Despite the study's
   limitations, including an incomplete representation of AI's overall
   effect on education and the absence of concrete integration guidelines,
   it is evident that AI technologies like ChatGPT present both significant
   benefits and risks. The study advocates for a thoughtful and responsible
   integration of such technologies within HEIs.},

Title = {The Personalization of Conversational Agents in Health Care: Systematic
   Review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {Background: The personalization of conversational agents with natural
   language user interfaces is seeing increasing use in health care
   applications, shaping the content, structure, or purpose of the dialogue
   between humans and conversational agents.
   Objective: The goal of this systematic review was to understand the ways
   in which personalization has been used with conversational agents in
   health care and characterize the methods of its implementation.
   Methods: We searched on PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and ACM
   Digital Library using a predefined search strategy. The studies were
   included if they: (1) were primary research studies that focused on
   consumers, caregivers, or health care professionals; (2) involved a
   conversational agent with an unconstrained natural language interface;
   (3) tested the system with human subjects; and (4) implemented
   personalization features.
   Results: The search found 1958 publications. After abstract and
   full-text screening, 13 studies were included in the review. Common
   examples of personalized content included feedback, daily health
   reports, alerts, warnings, and recommendations. The personalization
   features were implemented without a theoretical framework of
   customization and with limited evaluation of its impact. While
   conversational agents with personalization features were reported to
   improve user satisfaction, user engagement and dialogue quality, the
   role of personalization in improving health outcomes was not assessed
   directly.
   Conclusions: Most of the studies in our review implemented the
   personalization features without theoretical or evidence-based support
   for them and did not leverage the recent developments in other domains
   of personalization. Future research could incorporate personalization as
   a distinct design factor with a more careful consideration of its impact
   on health outcomes and its implications on patient safety, privacy, and
   decision-making.},

Title = {Health Chatbots in Africa: Scoping Review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {Background: This scoping review explores and summarizes the existing
   literature on the use of chatbots to support and promote health in
   Africa. Objective: The primary aim was to learn where, and under what
   circumstances, chatbots have been used effectively for health in Africa;
   how chatbots have been developed to the best effect; and how they have
   been evaluated by looking at literature published between 2017 and 2022.
   A secondary aim was to identify potential lessons and best practices for
   others chatbots. The review also aimed to highlight directions for
   future research on the use of chatbots for health in Africa. Methods:
   Using the 2005 Arksey and O'Malley framework, we used a Boolean search
   to broadly search literature published between January 2017 and July
   2022. Literature between June 2021 and July 2022 was identified using
   Google Scholar, EBSCO information services-which includes the African
   HealthLine, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Cochrane, Embase, Scopus, and Web
   of Science databases-and other internet sources (including gray
   literature). The inclusion criteria were literature about health
   chatbots in Africa published in journals, conference papers, opinion, or
   white papers. Results: In all, 212 records were screened, and 12
   articles met the inclusion criteria. Results were analyzed according to
   the themes they covered. The themes identified included the purpose of
   the chatbot as either providing an educational or information-sharing
   service or providing a counselling service. Accessibility as a result of
   either technical restrictions or language restrictions was also noted.
   Other themes that were identified included the need for the
   consideration of trust, privacy and ethics, and evaluation. Conclusions:
   The findings demonstrate that current data are insufficient to show
   whether chatbots are effectively supporting health in the region.
   However, the review does reveal insights into popular chatbots and the
   need to make them accessible through language considerations, platform
   choice, and user trust, as well as the importance of robust evaluation
   frameworks to assess their impact. The review also provides
   recommendations on the direction of future research.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine university students'
   experiences with the use of ChatGPT in online courses. The sample
   consisted of 84 associate degree students from a state university in
   Turkey. A multi-method approach was used in the study. Although
   quantitative data were collected using the Chatbot Usability Scale,
   qualitative data were collected using a semi-structured interview form
   that we developed. The data were analysed using descriptive and content
   analysis methods. According to the findings, ChatGPT exhibits advantages
   such as a user-friendly interface and fast, concise, relevant responses.
   Moreover, emphasizing its contribution to the learning process, the
   information provided was sufficient and topic-oriented. The
   understandability of the chatbot's functions and the clarity of their
   communication were emphasized. However, there are disadvantages such as
   performance issues, frequency of errors and the risk of providing
   misleading information. Concerns have also been raised about the
   potential difficulties chatbots may face in ambiguous conversations and
   providing insufficient information on privacy issues. In conclusion,
   ChatGPT is recognised as a potentially valuable tool in education based
   on positive usability impressions; however, more research is needed for

Title = {Promoting Physical Activity Through Conversational Agents: Mixed Methods
   Systematic Review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 14},
Abstract = {Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is crucial for well-being;
   however, healthy habits are difficult to create and maintain.
   Interventions delivered via conversational agents (eg, chatbots or
   virtual agents) are a novel and potentially accessible way to promote
   PA. Thus, it is important to understand the evolving landscape of
   research that uses conversational agents.
   Objective: This mixed methods systematic review aims to summarize the
   usability and effectiveness of conversational agents in promoting PA,
   describe common theories and intervention components used, and identify
   areas for further development.
   Methods: We conducted a mixed methods systematic review. We searched
   seven electronic databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, ACM
   Digital Library, Scopus, and Web of Science) for quantitative,
   qualitative, and mixed methods studies that conveyed primary research on
   automated conversational agents designed to increase PA. The studies
   were independently screened, and their methodological quality was
   assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool by 2 reviewers. Data on
   intervention impact and effectiveness, treatment characteristics, and
   challenges were extracted and analyzed using parallel-results convergent
   synthesis and narrative summary.
   Results: In total, 255 studies were identified, 7.8\% (20) of which met
   our inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the studies was
   varied. Overall, conversational agents had moderate usability and
   feasibility. Those that were evaluated through randomized controlled
   trials were found to be effective in promoting PA. Common challenges
   facing interventions were repetitive program content, high attrition,
   technical issues, and safety and privacy concerns.
   Conclusions: Conversational agents hold promise for PA interventions.
   However, there is a lack of rigorous research on long-term intervention
   effectiveness and patient safety. Future interventions should be based
   on evidence-informed theories and treatment approaches and should
   address users' desires for program variety, natural language processing,
   delivery via mobile devices, and safety and privacy concerns.},

   accessible health care solutions, the use of AI offers tremendous
   potential to improve emotional well-being. To realize this potential, it
   is imperative that AI service providers prioritize clear and consistent
   ethical guidelines that align with global considerations regarding user
   safety and privacy. This report offers a template for an ethical code
   that can be implemented by other emotional AI services and their
   affiliates. It includes practical guidelines for integrating support
   from clients, collaborators, and research partners. It also shows how
   existing ethical systems can inform the development of AI ethics.},

Abstract = {Can a chatbot enable us to change our conceptions, to be critically
   reflective? To what extent can interaction with a technologically
   ``minimal{''} medium such as a chatbot evoke emotional engagement in
   ways that can challenge us to act on the world? In this paper, we
   discuss the design of a provocative bot, a ``bot of conviction{''},
   aimed at triggering conversations on complex topics (e.g. death, wealth
   distribution, gender equality, privacy) and, ultimately, soliciting
   specific actions from the user it converses with. We instantiate our
   design with a use case in the cultural sector, specifically a Neolithic
   archaeological site that acts as a stage of conversation on such hard
   themes. Our larger contributions include an interaction framework for
   bots of conviction, insights gained from an iterative process of
   participatory design and evaluation, and a vision for bot interaction
   mechanisms that can apply to the HCI community more widely.},

Journal = {DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper presents a critical review of key ethical issues raised by
   the emergence of mental health chatbots. Chatbots use varying degrees of
   artificial intelligence and are increasingly deployed in many different
   domains including mental health. The technology may sometimes be
   beneficial, such as when it promotes access to mental health information
   and services. Yet, chatbots raise a variety of ethical concerns that are
   often magnified in people experiencing mental ill-health. These ethical
   challenges need to be appreciated and addressed throughout the
   technology pipeline. After identifying and examining four important
   ethical issues by means of a recognised ethical framework comprised of
   five key principles, the paper offers recommendations to guide chatbot
   designers, purveyers, researchers and mental health practitioners in the
   ethical creation and deployment of chatbots for mental health.},

Abstract = {Purpose For decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has been utilized
   within the field of mental healthcare. This paper aims to examine AI
   chatbots, specifically as offered through mobile applications for mental
   healthcare (MHapps), with attention to the social implications of these
   technologies. For example, AI chatbots in MHapps are programmed with
   therapeutic techniques to assist people with anxiety and depression, but
   the promise of this technology is tempered by concerns about the apps'
   efficacy, privacy, safety and security. Design/methodology/approach
   Utilizing a social informatics perspective, a literature review covering
   MHapps, with a focus on AI chatbots was conducted from the period of
   January-April 2019. A borrowed theory approach pairing information
   science and social work was applied to analyze the literature. Findings
   Rising needs for mental healthcare, combined with expanding
   technological developments, indicate continued growth of MHapps and
   chatbots. While an AI chatbot may provide a person with a place to
   access tools and a forum to discuss issues, as well as a way to track
   moods and increase mental health literacy, AI is not a replacement for a
   therapist or other mental health clinician. Ultimately, if AI chatbots
   and other MHapps are to have a positive impact, they must be regulated,
   and society must avoid techno-fundamentalism in relation to AI for
   mental health. Originality/value This study adds to a small but growing
   body of information science research into the role of AI in the support
   of mental health.},

   discuss, from a young person's perspective, the strengths and
   limitations of using chatbots in mental health support. We also outline
   what we consider to be minimum ethical standards for these platforms.
   including issues surrounding privacy and confidentiality. efficacy. and

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis paper offers a mini-review of OpenAI's language model,
   ChatGPT, detailing its mechanisms, applications in healthcare, and
   comparisons with other large language models (LLMs).MethodsThe
   underlying technology of ChatGPT is outlined, focusing on its neural
   network architecture, training process, and the role of key elements
   such as input embedding, encoder, decoder, attention mechanism, and
   output projection. The advancements in GPT-4, including its capacity for
   internet connection and the integration of plugins for enhanced
   functionality are discussed.ResultsChatGPT can generate creative,
   coherent, and contextually relevant sentences, making it a valuable tool
   in healthcare for patient engagement, medical education, and clinical
   decision support. Yet, like other LLMs, it has limitations, including a
   lack of common sense knowledge, a propensity for hallucination of facts,
   a restricted context window, and potential privacy
   concerns.ConclusionDespite the limitations, LLMs like ChatGPT offer
   transformative possibilities for healthcare. With ongoing research in
   model interpretability, common-sense reasoning, and handling of longer
   context windows, their potential is vast. It is crucial for healthcare
   professionals to remain informed about these technologies and consider

Abstract = {Background Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a
   versatile large language model-based generative artificial intelligence.
   It is proficient in a variety of tasks from drafting emails to coding to
   composing music to passing medical licensing exams. While the potential
   role of ChatGPT in plastic surgery is promising, evidence-based research
   is needed to guide its implementation in practice.Methods This review
   aims to summarize the literature surrounding ChatGPT's use in plastic
   surgery.Results A literature search revealed several applications for
   ChatGPT in the field of plastic surgery, including the ability to create
   academic literature and to aid the production of research. However, the
   ethical implications of using such chatbots in scientific writing
   requires careful consideration. ChatGPT can also generate high-quality
   patient discharge summaries and operation notes within seconds, freeing
   up busy junior doctors to complete other tasks. However, currently
   clinical information must still be manually inputted, and clinicians
   must consider data privacy implications. Its use in aiding patient
   communication and education and training is also widely documented in
   the literature. However, questions have been raised over the accuracy of
   answers generated given that current versions of ChatGPT cannot access
   the most up-to-date sources.Conclusions While one must be aware of its
   shortcomings, ChatGPT is a useful tool for plastic surgeons to improve
   productivity for a range of tasks from manuscript preparation to
   healthcare communication generation to drafting teaching sessions to
   studying and learning. As access improves and technology becomes more
   refined, surely more uses for ChatGPT in plastic surgery will become
   apparent.},

Title = {Applying the Digital Health Social Justice Guide},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Introduction Digital health, the use of apps, text-messaging, and online
   interventions, can revolutionize healthcare and make care more
   equitable. Currently, digital health interventions are often not
   designed for those who could benefit most and may have unintended
   consequences. In this paper, we explain how privacy vulnerabilities and
   power imbalances, including racism and sexism, continue to influence
   health app design and research. We provide guidelines for researchers to
   design, report and evaluate digital health studies to maximize social
   justice in health.Methods From September 2020 to April 2021, we held
   five discussion and brainstorming sessions with researchers, students,
   and community partners to develop the guide and the key questions. We
   additionally conducted an informal literature review, invited experts to
   review our guide, and identified examples from our own digital health
   study and other studies.Results We identified five overarching topics
   with key questions and subquestions to guide researchers in designing or
   evaluating a digital health research study. The overarching topics are:
   1. Equitable distribution; 2. Equitable design; 3. Privacy and data
   return; 4. Stereotype and bias; 5. Structural racism.Conclusion We
   provide a guide with five key topics and questions for social justice
   digital health research. Encouraging researchers and practitioners to
   ask these questions will help to spark a transformation in digital
   health toward more equitable and ethical research. Future work needs to
   determine if the quality of studies can improve when researchers use
   this guide.},

Abstract = {Successful collaboration between clinicians is particularly relevant
   regarding the quality of care process. In this context, the utilization
   of hybrid intelligence, such as conversational agents (CAs), is a
   reasonable approach for the coordination of diverse tasks. While there
   is a great deal of literature involving collaboration, little effort has
   been made to integrate previous findings and evaluate research when
   applying CAs in hospitals. By conducting an extended and systematic
   literature review and semi-structured expert interviews, we identified
   four major challenges and derived propositions where in-depth research
   is needed: 1) audience and interdependency; 2) connectivity and
   embodiment; 3) trust and transparency; and 4) security, privacy, and
   ethics. The results are helpful for researchers as we discuss directions
   for future research on CAs for collaboration in a hospital setting
   enhancing team performance. Practitioners will be able to understand
   which difficulties must be considered before the actual application of
   CAs.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS IN THE SCHOOLS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 6},
Abstract = {ChatGPT has garnered unprecedented popularity since its release in
   November 2022. This artificial intelligence (AI) large language model
   (LLM) is designed to generate human-like text based on patterns found in
   massive amounts of data scraped from the internet. ChatGPT is
   significantly different from previous versions of GPT by its quality of
   output, capability to interact and hold human-like conversations,
   enormous speed, and ability to have its output refined by users or
   experts. New iterations of ChatGPT as well as open source and
   alternative LLMs, and ChatGPT plugins extend the current capabilities of
   ChatGPT and offer unlimited opportunities to change how we do things.
   Despite its newfound popularity and capabilities, ChatGPT is fraught
   with concerns such as cheating, misinformation, bias, abuse and misuse,
   and privacy and safety. On the other hand, the integration of ChatGPT in
   the classroom prompts us to envision better ways of providing
   instruction and assessment of writing skills. ChatGPT also provides
   unparalleled approaches for personalized learning. As educators, we must
   consider and deal with the serious concerns of using ChatGPT but
   simultaneously explore how this AI technology can enhance and extend
   current methods of instruction. In this paper, authors explain what

Abstract = {With the fast-growing popularity of online social networks (OSN),
   maintaining the security of OSN ecosystems becomes essential for the
   public. Among all the security threats facing OSN, malicious social bots
   have become the most common and detrimental. These bot programs are
   often employed to violate users' privacy, distribute spam, and disturb
   the financial market, posing a compelling need for effective social bot
   detection solutions.
   Unlike traditional bot detection approaches that have strict
   requirements on data sources (e.g., private payload information, social
   relationships, or activity histories), this paper proposes a detection
   method called BotFlowMon that relies only on NetFlow data as input to
   identify OSN bot traffic, where every NetFlow record is a summary of a
   traffic flow on the Internet and contains no payload content. BotFlowMon
   introduces several new algorithms and techniques to help use machine
   learning to classify the social bot traffic from the real OSN user
   traffic, including aggregating NetFlow records to obtain transaction
   data, fusing transaction data to extract features and visualize flows,
   as well as subdividing transactions into basic actions. Our evaluation
   shows that with 535GB raw NetFlow records as input, BotFlowMon can
   efficiently classify the traffic from social bots, including chatbot,
   amplification bot, post bot, crawler bot, and hybrid bot, with
   92.33-93.61\% accuracy.},

Title = {Systematizing Audit in Algorithmic Recruitment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Business psychologists study and assess relevant individual differences,
   such as intelligence and personality, in the context of work. Such
   studies have informed the development of artificial intelligence systems
   (AI) designed to measure individual differences. This has been
   capitalized on by companies who have developed AI-driven recruitment
   solutions that include aggregation of appropriate candidates (Hiretual),
   interviewing through a chatbot (Paradox), video interview assessment
   (MyInterview), and CV-analysis (Textio), as well as estimation of
   psychometric characteristics through image-(Traitify) and game-based
   assessments (HireVue) and video interviews (Cammio). However, driven by
   concern that such high-impact technology must be used responsibly due to
   the potential for unfair hiring to result from the algorithms used by
   these tools, there is an active effort towards proving mechanisms of
   governance for such automation. In this article, we apply a systematic
   algorithm audit framework in the context of the ethically critical
   industry of algorithmic recruitment systems, exploring how audit
   assessments on AI-driven systems can be used to assure that such systems
   are being responsibly deployed in a fair and well-governed manner. We
   outline sources of risk for the use of algorithmic hiring tools, suggest
   the most appropriate opportunities for audits to take place, recommend
   ways to measure bias in algorithms, and discuss the transparency of
   algorithms.},

Title = {Designing Virtual Reality-Based Conversational Agents to Train
   Clinicians in Verbal De-escalation Skills: Exploratory Usability Study},
Journal = {JMIR SERIOUS GAMES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Violence and aggression are significant workplace challenges
   faced by clinicians worldwide. Traditional methods of training consist
   of ``on-the-job learning{''} and role-play simulations. Although both
   approaches can result in improved skill levels, they are not without
   limitation. Interactive simulations using virtual reality (VR) can
   complement traditional training processes as a cost-effective, engaging,
   easily accessible, and flexible training tool.
   Objective: In this exploratory study, we aimed to determine the
   feasibility of and barriers to verbal engagement with a virtual agent in
   the context of the Code Black VR application. Code Black VR is a new
   interactive VR-based verbal de-escalation trainer that we developed
   based on the Clinical Training Through VR Design Framework.
   Methods: In total, 28 participants with varying clinical expertise from
   4 local hospitals enrolled in the Western Sydney Local Health District
   Clinical Initiative Nurse program and Transition to Emergency Nursing
   Programs and participated in 1 of 5 workshops. They completed multiple
   playthroughs of the Code Black VR verbal de-escalation trainer
   application and verbally interacted with a virtual agent. We documented
   observations and poststudy reflection notes. After the playthroughs, the
   users completed the System Usability Scale and provided written comments
   on their experience. A thematic analysis was conducted on the results.
   Data were also obtained through the application itself, which also
   recorded the total interactions and successfully completed interactions.
   Results: The Code Black VR verbal de-escalation training application was
   well received. The findings reinforced the factors in the existing
   design framework and identified 3 new factors-motion sickness, perceived
   value, and privacy-to be considered for future application development.
   Conclusions: Verbal interaction with a virtual agent is feasible for
   training staff in verbal de-escalation skills. It is an effective medium
   to supplement clinician training in verbal de-escalation skills. We
   provide broader design considerations to guide further developments in
   this area.},

Abstract = {This research presents a comprehensive understanding of AI in the public
   sector based on a review of 78 studies. The literature review indicates
   that an AI-analytical model and AI-based automation system are mostly
   used at the organizational level whilst AI-recommender and chatbot
   applications are implemented within the citizens' services context. The
   results reveal that AI benefits such as cost reduction and
   decision-making improvements are accrued by governments. Further, the
   benefits of personalization and positive user experiences are directly
   useful to citizens. The review highlights that developing and adopting
   AI, presents two categories of challenges: AI obstacles at the
   organizational level, such as employees' resistance, lack of managerial,
   and financial support, and second - AI dilemmas linked to citizens such
   as AI ambiguity, bias, and privacy. Accordingly, this study provides
   recommendations for further research on AI within the government and the
   public sector.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to explore the advances in artificial
   intelligence (AI) chatbots as part of public services, mainly when
   applied to mental health in today's post-pandemic world. The adoption of
   AI chatbots to keep up with basic customer support business activities
   is based on extensive knowledge, both from the hard (software
   development) and the soft side (increasing the added value to the
   service/product). However, using chatbots as extenders of public
   services to support mental health in pandemic times is an emerging
   research topic. Hence, the paper identifies niche and under-explored
   research gaps in state-of-the-art literature, thus contributing to the
   body of academic knowledge. The paper adopts a design science approach
   to formulate the problem statement, articulate the objectives of target
   solutions, and propose a design and development framework for future
   mental health chatbots by employing an extensive literature review.
   Findings from this paper emphasize considerations of ethical issues and
   governance, purposeful and goal-oriented design, and AI-based technology
   as critical enablers for designing new mental health chatbots. The paper
   contributes to the knowledge by providing clear and structured future
   research priorities and offers a framework for designing more effective
   and intelligent mental health chatbots that public organizations and
   managers may find useful.},

Title = {The imperative for regulatory oversight of large language models (or
   generative AI) in healthcare},
Journal = {NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the
   development of sophisticated large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4
   and Bard. The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings
   has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse
   applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining
   insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as
   a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and
   concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very
   cautious approach since these models are trained differently from
   AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially
   within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version,
   GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this
   technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling
   results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being
   an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the
   context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in
   medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and
   transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure
   safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We
   argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and
   patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or
   privacy. This paper summarizes our practical recommendations for what we
   can expect from regulators to bring this vision to reality.},

Abstract = {Technology has played an important role in responding to the novel
   coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and subsequent COVID-19 pandemic. The virus's
   blend of lethality and transmissibility have challenged officials and
   exposed critical limitations of the traditional public health apparatus.
   However, throughout this pandemic, technology has answered the call for
   a new form of public health that illustrates opportunities for enhanced
   agility, scale, and responsiveness. The authors share the Microsoft
   perspective and illustrate how technology has helped transform the
   public health landscape with new and refined capabilities - the efficacy
   and impact of which will be determined by history. Technologies like
   chatbot and virtualized patient care offer a mechanism to triage and
   distribute care at scale. Artificial intelligence and high-performance
   computing have accelerated research into understanding the virus and
   developing targeted therapeutics to treat infection and prevent
   transmission. New mobile contact tracing protocols that preserve patient
   privacy and civil liberties were developed in response to public
   concerns, creating new opportunities for privacy-sensitive technologies
   that aid efforts to prevent and control outbreaks. While much progress
   is still needed, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted technology's
   importance to public health security and pandemic preparedness. Future
   multi-stakeholder collaborations, including those with technology
   organizations, are needed to facilitate progress in overcoming the
   current pandemic, setting the stage for improved pandemic preparedness
   in the future. As lessons are assessed from the current pandemic, public
   officials should consider technology's role and continue to seek
   opportunities to supplement and improve on traditional approaches.},

Abstract = {Depression is a chronic illness with even Olympic athletes {[}1] and top
   tennis players {[}2] withdrawing from competitions due to it. It's
   important to diagnose depression early. Traditional methods rely on
   questionnaires to evaluate depression. But they have their limitations
   due to inherent bias and inhibitions in self reporting. We propose an
   intelligent chatbot powered by AI approach to assist medical
   professionals diagnose depression. Specifically, the AI could predict
   depression symptoms in conversations with pre-care health care personnel
   and/or personal chats. Notably, due to sensitivity and privacy
   regulation (HIPPA) such data is not readily available {[}3]. To use AI
   driven medical assistants, and to overcome this limitation in training
   AI models, we propose to seed the models with recent chat engine
   (Discord) conversation dataset in the channel \#depression. We achieve
   at least 73\% accuracy in predicting seven key symptoms for depression
   using our best ML models. Secondly, with our ensemble random forest
   model we could recall 30-69\% of depression symptoms with 60-99\%
   depression diagnosis accuracy which could be further tuned by medical
   professional if they know which ones of these symptoms is a key
   predictor of depression.},

Abstract = {Background: The emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) based
   Conversational Agents (CA) capable of delivering evidence-based
   psychotherapy presents a unique opportunity to solve longstanding issues
   such as social stigma and demand-supply imbalance associated with
   traditional mental health care services. However, the emerging
   literature points to several socio-ethical challenges which may act as
   inhibitors to the adoption in the minds of the consumers. We also
   observe a paucity of research focusing on determinants of adoption and
   use of AI-based CAs in mental healthcare. In this setting, this study
   aims to understand the factors influencing the adoption and use of
   Intelligent CAs in mental healthcare by examining the perceptions of
   actual users.
   Method: The study followed a qualitative approach based on netnography
   and used a rigorous iterative thematic analysis of publicly available
   user reviews of popular mental health chatbots to develop a
   comprehensive framework of factors influencing the user's decision to
   adopt mental healthcare CA.
   Results: We developed a comprehensive thematic map comprising of four
   main themes, namely, perceived risk, perceived benefits, trust, and
   perceived anthropomorphism, along with its 12 constituent subthemes that
   provides a visualization of the factors that govern the user's adoption
   and use of mental healthcare CA.
   Conclusions: Insights from our research could guide future research on
   mental healthcare CA use behavior. Additionally, it could also aid
   designers in framing better design decisions that meet consumer
   expectations. Our research could also guide healthcare policymakers and
   regulators in integrating this technology into formal healthcare
   delivery systems.},

Abstract = {The recent emergence of publically facing artificial intelligence (AI)
   chatbots has generated vigorous discussion in the lay public around the
   possibilities, liabilities, and uncertainties of the integration of such
   technology into everyday life. As primary care clinicians continue to
   struggle against ever-increasing loads of asynchronous, electronic work,
   the potential for AI to improve the quality and efficiency of this work
   looms large. In this essay, we discuss the basic premise of open-access
   AI chatbots such as CHATGPT, review prior applications of AI in
   healthcare, and preview some possible AI chatbot-assisted in-basket
   assistance including scenarios of communicating test results with
   patients, providing patient education, and clinical decision support in
   history taking, review of prior diagnostic test characteristics, and
   common management scenarios. We discuss important concerns related to
   the future adoption of this technology including the transparency of the
   training data used in developing these models, the level of oversight
   and trustworthiness of the information generated, and possible impacts
   on equity, bias, and patient privacy. A stepwise and balanced approach
   to simultaneously understand the capabilities and address the concerns
   associated with these tools will be needed before these tools can

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have been progressing
   constantly and being more visible in different aspects of our lives. One
   recent phenomenon is ChatGPT, a chatbot with a conversational artificial
   intelligence interface that was developed by OpenAI. As one of the most
   advanced artificial intelligence applications, ChatGPT has drawn much
   public attention across the globe. In this regard, this study examines
   ChatGPT in education, among early adopters, through a qualitative
   instrumental case study. Conducted in three stages, the first stage of
   the study reveals that the public discourse in social media is generally
   positive and there is enthusiasm regarding its use in educational
   settings. However, there are also voices who are approaching cautiously
   using ChatGPT in educational settings. The second stage of the study
   examines the case of ChatGPT through lenses of educational
   transformation, response quality, usefulness, personality and emotion,
   and ethics. In the third and final stage of the study, the investigation
   of user experiences through ten educational scenarios revealed various
   issues, including cheating, honesty and truthfulness of ChatGPT, privacy
   misleading, and manipulation. The findings of this study provide several
   research directions that should be considered to ensure a safe and
   responsible adoption of chatbots, specifically ChatGPT, in education.},

Abstract = {There has been a major push to improve the transparency of online
   symptom checkers (OSCs) by providing more explanations to users about
   their functioning and conclusions. However, not all users will want
   explanations about all aspects of these systems. A more user-centered
   approach is necessary for personalizing user experience of explanations.
   With this in mind, we designed and tested an interactive dialogue
   interface to afford user control to receive only those explanations that
   they would like to read. A user study (N = 152) with a text-based
   chatbot for assessing anxiety levels and presented explanations to
   participants in one of the three forms-an interactive dialogue providing
   choice for viewing different components of the explanations, a static
   disclosure of all explanations, and a control condition with no
   explanations whatsoever. We found that participants varied in the kinds
   of information they wanted to learn. The interactive delivery of
   explanations led to higher levels of perceived transparency and
   affective trust in the system. Furthermore, both subjective and
   objective understanding of the mechanism used for assessing anxiety was
   higher for participants in the interactive dialogue condition. We
   discuss theoretical and practical implications of imbuing interactivity
   for enhancing the effectiveness of explainable systems.},

Title = {Chatbots in retailers' customer communication: How to measure their
   acceptance?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RETAILING AND CONSUMER SERVICES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {56},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Currently, online retailers evaluate whether chatbots-software programs
   that interact with users using natural languages-could improve their
   customers' satisfaction. In a retail context, chatbots allow humans to
   pose shopping-related questions and receive answers in natural language
   without waiting for a salesperson or using other automated communication
   forms. However, until now, it has been unclear which customers accept
   this new communication form and which factors determine their
   acceptance. In this paper, we contrast the well-known technology
   acceptance model (TAM) with the lesser known uses and gratifications
   (U\&G) theory, applying both approaches to measure the acceptance of the
   text-based ``Emma{''} chatbot by its target segment. ``Emma{''} was
   developed for the prepurchase phase of online fashion retailing and
   integrated into Facebook Messenger by the major German online retailer
   Zalando. Data were collected from 205 German Millennial respondents in a
   usability study. The results show that both utilitarian factors such as
   ``authenticity of conversation{''} and ``perceived usefulness,{''} as
   well as hedonic factors such as ``perceived enjoyment{''}, positively
   influence the acceptance of ``Emma{''}. However, privacy concerns and
   the immaturity of the technology had a negative effect on usage
   intention and frequency. The predictive power of both models was
   similar, showing little deviation, but U\&G gives alternative insights
   into the customers' motivation to use ``Emma{''} compared to the TAM.},

Title = {Value Co-Creation in Smart Services: A Functional Affordances
   Perspective on Smart Personal Assistants},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},

Pages = {418-458},
Abstract = {In the realm of smart services, smart personal assistants (SPAs) have
   become a popular medium for value co-creation between service providers
   and users. The market success of SPAs is largely based on their
   innovative material properties, such as natural language user
   interfaces, machine learning-powered request handling and service
   provision, and anthropomorphism. In different combinations, these
   properties offer users entirely new ways to intuitively and
   interactively achieve their goals and thus co-create value with service
   providers. But how does the nature of the SPA shape value co-creation
   processes? In this paper, we look through a functional affordances lens
   to theorize about the effects of different types of SPAs (i.e., with
   different combinations of material properties) on users' value
   co-creation processes. Specifically, we collected SPAs from research and
   practice by reviewing scientific literature and web resources, developed
   a taxonomy of SPAs' material properties, and performed a cluster
   analysis to group SPAs of a similar nature. We then derived 2 general
   and 11 cluster-specific propositions on how different material
   properties of SPAs can yield different affordances for value
   co-creation. With our work, we point out that smart services require
   researchers and practitioners to fundamentally rethink value co-creation
   as well as revise affordances theory to address the dynamic nature of
   smart technology as a service counterpart.},

Abstract = {Due to recent DNN advancements, many NLP problems can be effectively
   solved using transformer-based models and supervised data.
   Unfortunately, such data is not available in some languages. This
   research is based on assumptions that (1) training data can be obtained
   by the machine translating it from another language; (2) there are
   cross-lingual solutions that work without the training data in the
   target language. Consequently, in this research, we use the English
   dataset and solve the intent detection problem for five target languages
   (German, French, Lithuanian, Latvian, and Portuguese). When seeking the
   most accurate solutions, we investigate BERT-based word and sentence
   transformers together with eager learning classifiers (CNN, BERT
   fine-tuning, FFNN) and lazy learning approach (Cosine similarity as the
   memory-based method). We offer and evaluate several strategies to
   overcome the data scarcity problem with machine translation,
   cross-lingual models, and a combination of the previous two. The
   experimental investigation revealed the robustness of sentence
   transformers under various cross-lingual conditions. The accuracy equal
   to similar to 0.842 is achieved with the English dataset with completely
   monolingual models is considered our top-line. However, cross-lingual
   approaches demonstrate similar accuracy levels reaching similar to
   0.831, similar to 0.829, similar to 0.853, similar to 0.831, and similar
   to 0.813 on German, French, Lithuanian, Latvian, and Portuguese
   languages.},
