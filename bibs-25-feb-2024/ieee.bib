  abstract={Children's privacy concerns about smart toys are becoming more and more critical in the toy industry. Parents and guardians continue to strive to protect their children from unnecessary privacy risks such as collection, and unconsented use of or access to their children's information. However, there is still no standardized privacy framework, which focuses on smart toys in this paradigm; making it difficult to determine possible privacy violation in for example determining whether a phrase shared with a smart toy is sensitive or not. To overcome this challenge, we build a privacy identification system through Chatbot technology. We call this system a Children Privacy Identification (CPI) system. To develop CPI system, we divide our research works into two parts: (1) Collect the phrase from the smart toys; and (2) Explore privacy Identification based on Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). For illustration, we integrate the CPI system in LINE Chatbot. The result shows that people feel more comfortable in talking to LINE Chatbot with privacy protection.},

  abstract={Mental health chatbots can provide psychological counseling services to patients at any time regardless of time and location, which can not only relieve patients’ ailments but also reduce the workload of psychologists. In order to provide patients with accurate diagnosis and treatment services, mental health robots inevitably collect patient-related information during the communication process with patients, which is often very sensitive and must be well protected. There is a lack of targeted research on how mental health chatbots can provide systematic privacy preserving for patients in the process of providing mental health services to them. In this paper, we propose a privacy preserving framework based on blockchain and confidential computing that can provide comprehensive privacy preserving for patients during mental health chatbot services. We conduct tests using existing mental health chatbots, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework can meet the requirements for privacy preserving and computational performance of mental health chatbots.},

  abstract={With chatbots gaining traction and their adoption growing in different verticals, e.g. Health, Banking, Dating; and users sharing more and more private information with chatbots - studies have started to highlight the privacy risks of chatbots. In this paper, we propose two privacypreserving approaches for chatbot conversations. The first approach applies `entity' based privacy filtering and transformation, and can be applied directly on the app (client) side. It however requires knowledge of the chatbot design to be enabled. We present a second scheme based on Searchable Encryption that is able to preserve user chat privacy, without requiring any knowledge of the chatbot design. Finally, we present some experimental results based on a real-life employee Help Desk chatbot that validates both the need and feasibility of the proposed approaches.},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={In the rapidly evolving online digital landscape, privacy is an issue of great importance for individuals, while the use of web platforms handling personal data has reached significant levels. Regulations like the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enforce systems to integrate an array of privacy features allowing users to exercise their privacy rights and shield their personal data. However, users tend to find themselves overwhelmed or even ignorant, unsure of how to locate and use them. Research also showed that users find privacy policies hard to read and tend to skip them. This work introduces a novel approach to addressing these privacy concerns by presenting a user-centric solution to enhancing user privacy in web platforms and empowering users in handling their own personal data: an easy-to-use chatbot-based solution. The tool aims to provide a user-friendly and intuitive all-in-one interface, allowing users to easily navigate and access privacy features and manage their personal data while retrieving information about privacy aspects effortlessly from one location. An admin panel enables the customisation of important privacy parameters. We present the design and development process, evaluation and results.},

  abstract={The Metaverse is an incredible 3D virtual reality experience that anyone worldwide can access. It is a digital space not limited by geography, and it is made up of interconnected systems with unique rules and capabilities. The best thing about the Metaverse is that it allows people to interact with others in an environment that they might not have been able to visit otherwise. It is a perfect way to immerse oneself in other domains, such as entertainment and education, and it is also a great way to collaborate on projects with people worldwide. However, it is essential to note that the trustworthiness of the data collected from the disparate systems for the Metaverse needs to be studied in some areas. Trust is a significant issue in the Metaverse because users will interact with each other and virtual objects in a fully immersive environment. Security risks are also to consider, such as the attack surface that contributes to integrating various cutting-edge technology in the Metaverse. Additionally, the immersive workplace metaverse is subject to privacy risks to the users. Therefore, exploring the Metaverse’s security, privacy, and trust components is crucial to assist in research in these emerging areas. This research paper defines the trust framework and goals for Metaverse space, which are the key ingredients that ensure users use the products or services to buy, renew, and continue to trust their data. It is essential to address the trust issues to ensure the Metaverse is a safe, secure, and trustworthy experience for all users.},

  abstract={Globally, the problem of chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease is getting worse. These diseases have a significant impact on patients and healthcare systems. Innovative technologies like chatbots, which promise to improve the management of chronic diseases, have emerged as potential solutions to these difficulties. Chatbots are man-made brainpower (artificial intelligence) programs that can recreate discussions with people and give customized and practical consideration. The primary purposes of this study are to investigate the most important applications of chatbots in the management of chronic diseases, including personalized education, symptom monitoring, medication management, and lifestyle coaching. In addition, it discusses the potential advantages and disadvantages of chatbots in the management of chronic diseases, including the need for human oversight, data privacy, and patient engagement. The paper concludes that, although chatbots have the potential to transform the management of chronic diseases by providing personalized and cost-effective care, careful consideration of ethical, legal, and regulatory frameworks is required for their integration into healthcare systems.},

  abstract={Healthcare chatbots are becoming increasingly popular, but with their use comes the issues of excessive personal information collection and privacy leakage. To address this issue, we propose a Healthcare Chatbot-based Privacy Preserving (HCPP) Framework that adopts a data-oriented approach to reduce the excessive disclosure of personal information. HCPP consists of two main components: the Healthcare Chatbot-based Minimized Personal Information (HCMPI) method and the Healthcare Chatbot-based Zero Knowledge Proof (HCZKP) method. HCMPI leverages large language models (LLMs) to minimize the acquisition of unnecessary personal health information without significantly affecting healthcare service. HCZKP further encrypts a part of the minimized information, making the data available but invisible. The experimental evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our approach.},

  abstract={Mental health chatbots are AI chatbots that aim to mimic human conversations about how a user feels, help a user work through issues they are facing, suggest wellness exercises to complete, and help track a user’s mood over time. We compare the information disclosure practices and security and privacy concerns of adopters and non-adopters of mental health chatbots. We conducted a survey with 180 participants (30 adopters, 150 non-adopters), collecting data about what information they would hypothetically disclose to mental health chatbots, and concerns they had related to chatbots. We found that compared to non-adopters, adopters were more trusting of chatbots, were willing to reveal more information, perceived security and privacy risks to be less likely, and took fewer precautions.},

  abstract={AI technology is being introduced into various public and private service domains, transforming existing computing systems or creating new ones. While AI technologies can provide benefits to humans and society, the unexpected consequences (e.g., malfunctions) of AI systems can cause social losses. For this reason, research on ethical design for the development of AI-based systems is becoming important. In this paper, from existing studies on AI ethics, general guidelines such as transparency, explainability, predictability, accountability, fairness, privacy, and control for the ethical design of AI systems are reviewed. And, based on the ethical design guidelines, we discuss ethical design to reduce the negative effects of biased data and unethical dialogues in AI-based conversational chatbots.},

  abstract={Chatbot-based systems are recognised in literature as an effective tool to support chronic diseases self-management. However, the core of most of this work is on the description of the application domain and on the motivations behind the adoption of recommendation systems that exploit chatbot to mediate the interaction with users, but they fail in providing sufficient details on the system architecture and on the technology adopted. Moreover, they are usually designed with a strong focus on the specific pathology, and a reference architectural solution that can be adopted in different contexts is missing, thus making the work useful only in the domain it is devised for. In this paper we provide a framework for developing recommendation systems based on chatbots that is meant to be applied in different scenarios. The framework is composed by a back-end recommendation engine that autonomously computes the user's adherence profile to prescription, and proactively provides motivational feedback to the user through the application front-end based on a chatbot. The chatbot is also meant to collect and aggregate data for profiling the individual health and habits. To demonstrate the feasibility of our framework, we present a recommendation system, based on a Telegram chatbot, that has been developed and trained for managing hypertensive patients.},

The bot will have the ability to encrypt and decrypt files, allowing users to share sensitive information with confidence. The encryption and decryption will be performed using AES algorithms to ensure the security of the files. To further enhance security and scalability, the chatbot will be deployed to a cloud platform, allowing it to be accessed from anywhere and handle a larger number of users. Additionally, this project will also focus on implementing data preservation functionality within the chatbot. This will ensure that files are retained and accessible even when they are deleted from the Telegram chat or when the chatbot is deployed to the doud. This will be achieved through techniques such as data backup and disaster recovery to ensure data availability. Overall, this aims to provide a secure and reliable system for sharing files through Telegram, that guarantees the security of the files, the availability of the data and the scalability of the system. It is tailored for organizations, businesses and individuals who need to share sensitive information regularly.},

  abstract={In recent years, also due to the covid-19 pandemic, the possibilities for distance learning have increased considerably, through web-based learning platforms, available on the Internet without space and time limits. As a result, the offer of courses and the number of enrolled students has grown exponentially. In order to be able to guarantee students a better learning support service, one of the proposals regards the intelligent Chatbots. These well known interactive applications are based mainly on machine or deep learning and in this paper we present Boulez, a system allowing the orchestration of a community of individual chatbots, each one with its algorithm and its private training dataset. We apply a technique called Federated Learning, where several individual chatbots, collaborate. In particular, here the approach is “centralized”, meaning that a main system orchestrates the collaboration of the federated systems. By addressing the communication inefficiencies and privacy issues of conventional federated learning, Boulez offers a more efficient and effective approach to chatbot interaction, ultimately leading to improved user experience. The paper presents the Boulez system, its operation principle, methods used, and potential benefits, along with a use case of its application.},

  abstract={With a primary focus on cybersecurity risks, this study endeavors to explore the sustainable deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots and, ultimately, to promote their social sustainability. The study introduces an enhanced model built upon the “Protection Motivation Theory” (PMT) to explore the factors that predict the social sustainability of AI chatbots. The proposed model is evaluated using both “structural equation modeling” and “artificial neural network” (ANN) analyses, leveraging data obtained from 1741 participants. The findings reveal that PMT factors significantly predict the sustainable use of AI chatbots. Moreover, cybersecurity concerns, including confidentiality and privacy, have emerged as significant predictors of sustainable use, impacting the social sustainability of AI chatbots. The indicated paths in the model explain 70% and 74% of the variance in sustainable use and social sustainability, respectively. The results from the ANN analysis also emphasize the critical role of confidentiality as the primary predictor. The significance of this study lies in the development of a unified model that integrates cybersecurity and PMT, offering a distinctive framework. In addition to its theoretical contributions, the study offers practical insights for service providers, application developers, and decision-makers in the field, thereby influencing the future of AI chatbots.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},

  pages={1634-1642},
  abstract={Over the past decade, the use of chatbots for educational purposes has gained considerable traction. A similar trend has been observed in social coding platforms, where automated agents support software developers with tasks such as performing code reviews. While incorporating code reviews and social coding platforms into software engineering education has been found to be beneficial, challenges such as steep learning curves and privacy considerations are barriers to their adoption. Furthermore, no study has addressed the role chatbots play in supporting code reviews as a pedagogical tool. To help address this gap, we developed an online learning application that simulates the code review features available on social coding platforms and allows instructors to interact with students using chatbot identities. We then embedded this application within a lesson on software engineering best practices and conducted a controlled in-class experiment. This experiment examined the effect that explaining content via chatbot identities had on three aspects: (i) students’ perceived usability of the lesson, (ii) their engagement with the code review process, and (iii) their learning gains. While our findings show that it is feasible to simulate the code review process within an online learning platform and achieve good usability, our quantitative analysis did not yield significant differences across treatment conditions for any of the aspects considered. Nevertheless, our qualitative results suggest that students expect explicit feedback when performing this type of exercise and could thus benefit from automated replies provided by an interactive chatbot. We propose to build on our current findings to further explore this line of research in future work.},

  abstract={Skills, are essential components in Smart Personal Assistants (SPA). The number of skills has grown rapidly, dominated by a changing environment that has no clear business model. Skills can access personal information and this may pose a risk to users. However, there is little information about how this ecosystem works, let alone the tools that can facilitate its study. In this article, we present the largest systematic measurement of the Amazon Alexa skill ecosystem to date. We study developers’ practices in this ecosystem, including how they collect and justify the need for sensitive information, by designing a methodology to identify over-privileged skills with broken privacy policies. We collect 199,295 Alexa skills and uncover that around 43% of the skills (and 50% of the developers) that request these permissions follow bad privacy practices, including (partially) broken data permissions traceability. In order to perform this kind of analysis at scale, we present SkillVet that leverages machine learning and natural language processing techniques, and generates high-accuracy prediction sets. We report several concerning practices, including how developers can bypass Alexa's permission system through account linking and conversational skills, and offer recommendations on how to improve transparency, privacy and security. Resulting from the responsible disclosure we did, 13% of the reported issues no longer pose a threat at submission time.},

  abstract={Covert communication refers to the practice of exchanging information or messages in a discreet or secretive manner, with the intent of keeping the communication hidden from unintended or unauthorized recipients. Steganography is a widely used, strategy for establishing covert communication, for maintaining the privacy and security of sensitive information. Steganography ensures that the message remains concealed from surveillance or eavesdropping. Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in enhancing security across various domains of covert communication. ChatGPT is an AI model, specifically a natural language processing (NLP) model. It belongs to the broader category of AI models which can comprehend and produce language for humans. In this paper, a new image steganographic model named CGIS is developed for covert communication using ChatGPT. Proposed steganographic method has achieved 3.0 bpp of hiding capacity. In situations where confidentiality is critical, such as in military operations, intelligence agencies, or corporate strategies, proposed method ensures that the message cannot be detected and or extracted by any surveillance or eavesdropper.},

  abstract={The use of technology is a necessary component for the success of business operations. Yet cyber risks related to technology are well known. In previous works, three different layers were defined to be responsible of the cyber physical security of any given system: the network layer, the device layer and the human factor layer. However, statistics and experience have proven that the third factor is the weakest link in the cyber security of any company. This factor is divided into two subsections: the ignorance of the user (which will be treated in this paper) and the malignancy of the user. As the two previous layers were presented in previous works, this paper will focus on enhancing security by raising the cyber awareness of users thus creating a human firewall. For that, an AI-based conversational bot that focuses on cyber threat awareness and acts as a personal assistant relating to security issues was developed. This bot is based on AI-approach and it is used to make the interaction with the user appealing and friendly through the use of WhatsApp as a mean of communication. The implementation and testing of this bot has shown great interest for the users who have tried it due to its simplicity, the quality of deliverable data and the evaluation technique.},

  abstract={In this work, we propose a computational framework that leverages existing out-of-language data to create a conversational agent for the delivery of Self-Attachment Technique (SAT) in Mandarin. Our framework does not require large-scale human translations, yet it achieves a comparable performance whilst also maintaining safety and reliability. We propose two different methods of augmenting available response data through empathetic rewriting. We evaluate our chatbot against a previous, English-only SAT chatbot through non-clinical human trials (N = 42), each lasting five days, and quantitatively show that we are able to attain a comparable level of performance to the English SAT chatbot. We provide qualitative analysis on the limitations of our study and suggestions with the aim of guiding future improvements.},

  abstract={Mental health is one of the most pressing challenges in today's modern world. Traditional thinking, family pressure, unemployment issues, homesickness, and an unhappy relationship are the most common reasons for mental illness, which may also lead to suicidal attempts. People in impoverished countries do not give this issue enough attention. Furthermore, many are hesitant to seek professional counseling from a psychiatrist to retain their privacy. Monitoring social media activities, in addition to common symptoms, is critical for improving the accuracy of detecting early signs of mental illness because it impacts mental health. So, rather than a psychiatrist, a user-friendly deep learning-based mobile application that will chat with them to support and monitor their social media behaviors to determine their mental health status will be an effective way of handling the situation. This study proposes a deep learning-based chatbot framework to help mentally ill individuals identify their mental health conditions and provide appropriate therapy. This framework comprises three components: a keylogger module, a chat module, and a deep learning-based mental illness detection module. In the background, the keylogger collects data from the user's keyboard to track social media activity. The chatbot converses with users and stores their daily chat history in real-time. Both modules pass the data to a deep learning model to determine mental health conditions. This study also compared the accuracy of multiple deep learning classifiers such as Conv-LSTM and BERT for the Reddit Mental Health Dataset.},

  abstract={The evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT), progressing from a hyper-connected world of seamless device interaction to a paradigm that emphasizes the human factor as a central component, is driven by approaches like human-in-the-loop IoT (HITL-IoT). This shift enables the development of innovative systems in various environments. For example, in the context of a smart city, which comprises diverse solutions aimed at enhancing citizens’ quality of life and urban service efficiency, HITL-IoT approaches are employed to promote sustainability. Given the strong human involvement in these systems, challenges related to personal data protection, transparency, and participation must be addressed. Additionally, ensuring interoperability among different smart city entities is crucial for the coexistence and synergy of these solutions. This article presents a model that incorporates contemporary technologies like Blockchain and LoRa to integrate citizen-centric IoT privacy preservation solutions, fostering the vision of smart and sustainable cities. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model, a prototype was designed, implemented, and deployed in a realistic scenario. Assessment results include metrics, such as latency, throughput, and communication aspects of the components.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been used for some years and is growing rapidly. We are living in a world where AI has been involved in many different ways; from helping us to perform online search, shopping on the internet, customer service over internet, medical research, advices over banking activities, advices for legal matters, or to determine different stages of our life, even since when a baby is born. AI has also been significantly having a strong impact on the way we conduct business; for example, customer analysis, product research, trend analysis, making price policy, and recruiting process. However, awareness levels among end-users is still low. Authorities and industries are still looking for possibilities to regulate, optimise and harmonise negative issues that have been raised. In addition to just following general policies, developers and companies also need to take ethical issues into consideration in order to build trustworthy AI powered systems. This paper is aiming to design a conceptual framework by seeking possibilities in/among known debates, issues, theories, policies, dilemmas, and with personal view, instead of finding general solutions.

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={The voice modality has become the most prominent channel in the rapidly emerging field of human-computer interactions. Emotional connection is the foundation of successful communication. Our words are enhanced in human-to-human interactions by emotional undertones, vocal specifics, and contextual interpretations. When correctly interpreted, these hidden signals open the door to empathy, understanding, and effective communication. However, this emotional depth is not addressed in human computer verbal interactions. The challenge is comparable to having a conversation in which the words are understood but the feelings are not. Our idea focuses on bridging this emotional divide. We introduce an innovative approach to human-computer vocal interactions using a blend of advanced Natural Language Processing and Fuzzy Logic-based Voice Sentiment Analysis. Because human emotions are naturally complex, we use fuzzy logic to extract nuanced sentiment scores from voice inputs. Both the content, which is obtained from NLP, and the tone, which is modified to either mirror or contradict the detected sentiment, are informed by these evaluations in the form of voice. This bonds people with AI not only through words but also through emotions. Such a system has broad applications, from emotionally intelligent virtual assistants to support lines and teletherapy solutions. By ensuring AI can not only understand but also respond aptly to human emotion, bringing AI one step closer to reality.},

  abstract={Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is gained immense popularity among IT leaders over the years. RPA Bots are often easily and quickly deployed for automating repetitive business processes or tasks, which successively helps organizations to save lots of a substantial amount of their time and money. There are several success stories which vouch for usage of RPA, at the same time, there are some key aspects to be taken care in terms of security to minimize problems with the RPA. RPA automates a process, reducing human intervention and involvement. So, many expect it increases security by default. It should be noted, automation doesn’t mean it ensures security and compliance of the process by default. It's important to note that the method of RPA can often be quite risky in some cases. This is because RPA bots will handle sensitive data and transmitting it across systems associated with the business for various processes. So, if the sensitive data is not secured in right manner, it might get exposed, which can impact the business. So, while considering RPA, an organization should make sure it understands the security implications to the business process. With this paper, we would like to present a holistic approach to address all key aspects organizations needs to take care in terms of security, compliance and auditability starting from identification of the business case, design and development of the RPA bots till usage. It covers the crucial 3rd dimension of RPA Bot, along with the software and human user of the traditional software usage to consider and ensure overall security and compliance of the business process.},

However, current improvements in processing power, the accessibility of huge amounts of data, and improved algorithms have led to significant advancements in AI. A chatbot is a software program with AI that simulates user interactions. Healthcare chatbots gradually eliminate hospital wait times, appointments, and consultation meetups, thus instantly assisting patients in connecting with the right doctor. Chatbots reduce the workload of healthcare providers by decreasing the number of hospital visits and unnecessary treatments, providing suggestions and alerts. However, the introduction of such chatbots in the healthcare domain exposes users to a plethora of challenges. This paper presents a systematic survey of recent developments by researchers in the field of healthcare chatbots.

  abstract={A "chatbot" is a computer programme that interacts with and processes human conversations while also enabling humans to interact with and communicate with digital devices. It is also described as one of the most advanced and promising expressions of interactions between humans and machines. Its main task is to help students by providing answers to their questions. Existing chatbots are not entirely secure and can create open passages for cyber criminals or hackers to access the data flowing through the chatbot interface. So the chatbot will be made secure using the techniques of authentication (session) timeout and encryption. "Encryption is a method of secure communication that prevents others from accessing data while it is being transferred from one end system to another. The data is encrypted on the sender’s system, so only the intended recipient can decrypt it. " Authentication (session) timeout restricts a time limit on how long an authenticated user can stay "logged in," so this prevents cyber criminals from having enough time to predict their way into somebody’s secured account. This review addresses the various methods and techniques that assist in protecting the student’s information from hackers and making the conversations secure for both the educational institute and the students.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},

  pages={33-40},
  abstract={During development and deployment of Government-to-Citizen (G2C) e-services, stakeholders must take cybersecurity risks into account. Recently, Estonia proposed a novel e-service delivery through the use of virtual assistants. Cybersecurity is important to any organization due to the prevalence of attacks in recent times. Organizations in both the public sector and private sector typically have a program that determines, calculates and treats risks. These programs are identified as “risk management,” and cybersecurity risk assessment and analysis are a key part of these organizations. When correctly implemented, these programs can help decision makers allocate their cyber defense budgets in a more effective manner.The researchers conducted interviews with seven cybersecurity experts discussing cybersecurity data, metrics and risk assessment and analysis methods. These interviews informed the use of the Open Group’s Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) model in this paper.Because Estonia is one of the first countries in the world to prioritize e-service development in this domain, there is a literature gap pertaining to cybersecurity risk analyses of virtual assistant enabled e-services. Although a multiplicity of methods exist for risk assessment and analysis, this research follows the FAIR method to assess a G2C e-service which uses a third party provider for an Amazon Alexa skill that has become corrupted due to malware infection. The FAIR method projects the risk for a particular vulnerability in terms of dollar amount loss over time. It states the annualized loss exposure in terms of a minimum loss, a maximum loss, and a most likely amount of loss.Aggregated global public sector cyber breach frequency data was taken from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse database and loss magnitude data was taken from the Cyentia IRIS 2020 report which utilized the Advisen cyber loss database. Based upon a Project Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) distribution Monte Carlo simulation of this data, the annualized loss exposure projection for the public sector entity was $0 minimum likely value, most likely value $70,500 and maximum likely value of $6,000,000. Future work proposes more country and organization specific data for FAIR methodology use for G2C virtual assistant e-services analysis. The value of the work is that it shows how public sector agencies could use the FAIR model to make their cybersecurity risk models more quantitative than is generally currently practiced even in cases of new types of developments and services in order to aid decision-makers in allocation of funding to better defend against the most impactful risks.},

The advantages of using robots include the ability to carry out a psychodrama alone and to provide privacy-friendly support. In the experiment, a scenario was created for medical staff and a robot psychodrama was performed. As a result, we showed that robots can be used for psychodrama and esteem support can be carried out by combination of robots and the chatbot.},

  abstract={Many people are concerned about how their personal data is used for online behavioral advertising (OBA). Ad targeting explanations have been proposed as a way to reduce this concern by improving transparency. However, it is unclear when and why people might want ad targeting explanations. Without this insight, we run the risk of designing explanations that do not address real concerns. To bridge this gap, we conducted a four-week, mixed-methods field study with 60 participants to understand when and why people want targeting explanations for the ads they actually encountered while browsing the web. We found that users wanted explanations for around 30% of the 4,251 ads we asked them about during the study, and that subjective perceptions of how their personal data was collected and shared were highly correlated with when users wanted ad explanations. Often, users wanted these explanations to confirm or deny their own preconceptions about how their data was collected or the motives of advertisers. A key upshot of our work is that one-size-fits-all approaches to ad explanations are likely to fail at addressing people’s lived concerns about ad targeting; instead, more personalized explanations are needed.},

  abstract={Customer service plays a crucial role for a company. As an important aspect of e-commerce companies, they would be required to directly interact and try to solve customers’ problems that might occur anywhere and anytime. However, the limitation of human man hours became a barrier to overcome customers’ problems. On one hand, the rapid development of technology was predicted to replace the traditional human customer service with an Artificial Intelligence agent. On the other hand, this replacement affects the customer satisfaction. This paper performed a study literature review to discover the effect of chatbots and its impact towards customer satisfaction. In an e-commerce customer service use case, chatbots could be implemented in a number of methods. The methods implemented by chatbots are avatar-based, verbal-based, text-based, and menu-based. Research showed that text-based chatbot is the most commonly used methodology and has advanced the most, where some are implementing higher level machine learning methods, such as deep learning. The usage of such chatbot in e-commerce customer service systems will lower the cost but might also lower customer satisfaction, due to reasons such as unsatisfying answers and inhuman behavior. Research showed that even a more sophisticated chatbot doesn’t always mean higher customer satisfaction, even with high accuracy ratings. To look into customer satisfaction, this paper has identified 4 aspects of a chatbot that are relevant to customer satisfaction, which are privacy, reliability, personalization, and responsiveness. Chatbots currently excel in some of these quality measures, but require further research to effectively replace human customer service agents.},

  abstract={AI is shaping our society and changing what it means to be human. The future is getting frenetic since the adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) in our everyday life. Humanity is slowly transcending from a society of consumers to creators. We first began with Siri and Alexa; now it is ChatGPT, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion and several other tools powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Audi as well has started the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to get inspiration on wheel design. This paper will focus on: the advantages; the social and cultural impact that GenAI opposes; use cases on how GenAI can enhance innovation and drive business value from the technical prospect; the potential risks that might arise if GenAI is abused and conclude with how technology teams alongside the C-Suite and Board of Directors should take action. These risks include deepfakes, legal confusion, hiring biases and inaccurate chatbots. AI is in the service of humanity and it is a responsibility of ours to treat(/train) it with dignity and fairness.},

  abstract={This paper deals with a cybergrooming and sexual misconduct topic in artificial intelligence-based educational programs. Although cybergrooming has been recognized as a cybercrime, there is a lack of programs to protect youth from cybergrooming. We present a generative chatbot framework, SERI (Stop cybERgroomIng), that can generate fluent authentic conversations in the context of cybergrooming between a perpetrator chatbot and a potential victim chatbot. Furthermore, we propose deep-reinforcement-learning-based dialogue generation with a stage-related reward to lead the conversation to the expected stage. We also minimize potential ethical issues introduced by the perverted languages when deploying the chatbots for cybersecurity education programs. We evaluated the conversations of SERI with open-source referenced, unreferenced metrics and human evaluation. We developed SERI as a platform for deploying perpetrator chatbot to interact with youth users to observe their responses and collect reactions when they are asked for private or sensitive information by the perpetrator.},

  abstract={Collaborative Customer Relationship Management (CCRM) has developed Automated Customer Support Services (ACSS), where it focuses on providing more efficient and immediate customer service. Through chatbots, virtual customers, internet routing, and automated responses, technology has evolved to aid the customer support sector through automations trained by Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and other advancements in technology. However, ACSS is relatively new with various implementation frameworks in choosing ACSS platforms developed by CRM experts for organizations. The study aims to cover the research gaps of integrating the customer perspective in terms of behavioral trends, data security issues, engagement and responses, and proper maintenance and evaluation of the ACSS performance based on the customer relationships and experience, through the development of a new implementation framework for ACSS in an organization. Through a rating-questionnaire answered by CRM experts on three (3) different ACSS based on different frameworks and the developed one by the study, the findings show that the developed framework enhances customer relationships and experiences more than the existing frameworks, thereby validating the effectiveness of the implementation framework in the study.},

  abstract={Social networks have been the widespread popular tools for communication and socialization, and it also been the ideal platform for bots to publish malicious information. Therefore, social bot detection is essential for the social network's security. Existing methods almost ignore the differences in bot behaviors in multiple domains. Thus, we first propose a DomainAware detection method with Multi-Relational Graph neural networks (DA-MRG) to improve detection performance. Specifically, DA-MRG constructs multi-relational graphs with users' features and relationships, obtains the user presentations with graph embedding and distinguishes bots from humans with domainaware classifiers. Meanwhile, considering the similarity between bot behaviors in different social networks, we believe that sharing data among them could boost detection performance. However, the data privacy of users needs to be strictly protected. To overcome the problem, we implement a study of federated learning framework for DA-MRG to achieve data sharing between different social networks and protect data privacy simultaneously. We conduct extensive experiments on TwiBot-20, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively achieve federated social bot detection.},

Not only are intelligent systems such as autonomous vehicles taking the streets, but recommendation algorithms are shaping human behavior. While AI offers a significant increase in efficiency, it can also indirectly cause harm to humans by replacing jobs, violating privacy and even threatening autonomy. To keep track of these cases in which AI has negative implications on a human, databases of AI incidents have been created. We extend this idea of AI incidents to not only include times whereby an AI system caused a real-world harm, but also when it introduces a benefit. Prior work in adjacent fields has defined taxonomies and standard procedures for root cause analysis, digital forensics, AI risk management, and more. Despite these frameworks, there is no means to investigate an AI system to discover the root cause of an incident. We aim to evaluate the body of knowledge that leads to introducing the field of AI Forensics. AI forensics can serve as a postmortem analysis of AI incidents to discover the primary harm catalyst.},

  abstract={With the fast-growing popularity of online social networks (OSNs), the security and privacy of OSN ecosystems becomes essential for the public. Among threats OSNs face, malicious social bots have become the most common and detrimental. They are often employed to violate users’ privacy, distribute spam, and disturb the financial market, posing a compelling need for effective social bot detection solutions. Unlike traditional social bot detection approaches that have strict requirements on data sources (e.g., private payload information, social relationships, or activity histories), this article proposes a method called BotFlowMon that relies only on content-agnostic flow-level data as input to identify OSN bot traffic. BotFlowMon introduces several new algorithms and techniques to classify social bot traffic from real OSN user traffic, including aggregating network flow records to obtain OSN transaction data, fusing transaction data to extract features and visualize flows, and an innovative density-valley-based clustering algorithm to subdivide each transaction into individual actions. The evaluation shows BotFlowMon can identify the traffic from social bots with a 96.1 percent accuracy, which, based on the worst case study on a testing machine, only takes no more than 0.71 seconds on average after it sees the traffic.},

  abstract={In a Data-Centric AI paradigm, the model performance is enhanced without altering the model architecture, as evidenced by real-world and benchmark dataset demonstrations. With the advancements of large language models (LLM), it has become increasingly feasible to generate high-quality synthetic data, while considering the need to construct fully synthetic datasets for real-world data containing numerous personal information. However, in-depth validation of the solely synthetic data setting has yet to be conducted, despite the increased possibility of models trained exclusively on fully synthetic data emerging in the future. Therefore, we examined the question, “Do data quality control techniques (known to positively impact data-centric AI) consistently aid models trained exclusively on synthetic datasets?”. To explore this query, we performed detailed analyses using synthetic datasets generated for speech recognition postprocessing using the BackTranScription (BTS) approach. Our study primarily addressed the potential adverse effects of data quality control measures (e.g., noise injection and balanced data) and training strategies in the context of synthetic-only experiments. As a result of the experiment, we observed the negative effect that the data-centric methodology drops by a maximum of 44.03 points in the fully synthetic data setting.},

  abstract={With the widespread use of large artificial intelligence (AI) models such as ChatGPT, AI-generated content (AIGC) has garnered increasing attention and is leading a paradigm shift in content creation and knowledge representation. AIGC uses generative large AI algorithms to assist or replace humans in creating massive, high-quality, and human-like content at a faster pace and lower cost, based on user-provided prompts. Despite the recent significant progress in AIGC, security, privacy, ethical, and legal challenges still need to be addressed. This paper presents an in-depth survey of working principles, security and privacy threats, state-of-the-art solutions, and future challenges of the AIGC paradigm. Specifically, we first explore the enabling technologies, general architecture of AIGC, and discuss its working modes and key characteristics. Then, we investigate the taxonomy of security and privacy threats to AIGC and highlight the ethical and societal implications of GPT and AIGC technologies. Furthermore, we review the state-of-the-art AIGC watermarking approaches for regulatable AIGC paradigms regarding the AIGC model and its produced content. Finally, we identify future challenges and open research directions related to AIGC.},

  abstract={In the past few years, ChatGPT has evolved into a powerful N.L.P. technology, with applications ranging from text generation to question resolution. However, there is still relatively little research on how the public perceives this technology. In this research, we use sentiment analysis techniques to assess the sentiment of tweets regarding ChatGPT. Users manually categorized a dataset of tweets mentioning ChatGPT as positive, negative, or indifferent based on their attitude. The overall sentiment of the tweets was therefore directly determined utilizing machine learning models including logistic regression and support vector machines. Our results show that the majority of tweets related to ChatGPT are neutral, while a smaller proportion are positive or negative. We also found that certain words and phrases, such as "AI" and "language model", are strongly associated with positive sentiment, while others, such as "bias" and "privacy", are associated with negative sentiment. These findings have important implications for the development and deployment of ChatGPT and other NLP technologies, as they suggest that public perception is influenced by factors such as trust, transparency, and ethical considerations. Overall, this paper highlights the importance of understanding public sentiment towards emerging technologies like ChatGPT, and the potential of sentiment analysis techniques to shed light on these issues},

  pages={380-389},
  abstract={Sentiment Analysis Systems (SASs) are data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that output polarity and emotional intensity when given a piece of text as input. Like other AIs, SASs are also known to have unstable behavior when subjected to changes in data which can make them problematic to trust out of concerns like bias when AI works with humans and data has protected attributes like gender, race, and age. Recently, an approach was introduced to assess SASs in a blackbox setting without training data or code, and rating them for bias using synthetic English data. We augment it by introducing two human-generated chatbot datasets and also considering a round-trip setting of translating the data from one language to the same through an intermediate language. We find that these settings show SASs performance in a more realistic light. Specifically, we find that rating SASs on the chatbot data showed more bias compared to the synthetic data, and round-tripping using Spanish and Danish as intermediate languages reduces the bias (up to 68% reduction) in human-generated data while, in synthetic data, it takes a surprising turn by increasing the bias! Our findings will help researchers and practitioners refine their SAS testing strategies and foster trust as SASs are considered part of more mission-critical applications for global use.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={000415-000420},
  abstract={The swift progress of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, and natural language processing brought massive changes across diverse domains. A substantial body of research underscored the advantages of AI technologies for consumers and identified motivational factors for their adoption. Current systematic literature reviews usually examined the traditional Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and AI Device Use Acceptance (AIDUA), focused on a single solution or technology. On the other hand, the importance of perceived switching cost and measurement of switching behavior is an essential part of well-established and widely used theories (Push-Pull-Mooring (PPM) framework, Status Quo Bias theory, Lazy User Theory, etc.). By following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, this literature review highlights studies that observe switching costs and switching behavior towards AI-based solutions. $\mathrm{N} = 2,739$ articles were initially identified in prominent databases (IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCO Host). After screening, $n = 7$ articles were deemed suitable for inclusion, and most of them relied on the Dual-factor framework and PPM framework. In many cases, these frameworks were integrated with theories and models such as the Status Quo Bias theory, UTAUT, TAM, and TAM3 to provide an understanding of underlying factors affecting user behavior and decision-making. Positive factors influencing switching behavior towards AI adoption include recognizing human limitations, while simultaneously perceiving advantages of AI technology, such as ease of use, efficiency, and personalized experiences. Negative factors, which hinder AI acceptance, encompass privacy risks, inertia, uncertainty, regret avoidance, and cognitive biases.},

  abstract={As a specific category of artificial intelligence (AI), generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) generates new content that resembles what humans create. The rapid development of GenAI systems has created a huge amount of new data on the Internet, posing new challenges to current computing and communication frameworks. Currently, GenAI services rely on the traditional cloud computing framework due to the need for large computation resources. However, such services will encounter high latency because of data transmission and a high volume of user requests. On the other hand, edge-cloud computing can provide adequate computation power and low latency at the same time through the collaboration between edges and the cloud. Thus, it is attractive to build GenAI systems at scale by leveraging the edge-cloud computing paradigm. In this overview paper, we review recent developments in GenAI and edge-cloud computing, respectively. Then, we use two exemplary GenAI applications to discuss technical challenges in scaling up their solutions using edge-cloud collaborative systems. Finally, we list design considerations for training and deploying GenAI systems at scale and point out future research directions.},

This study investigates the benefits, issues, and challenges of using ChatGPT, a language AI model, in programming tasks. Data was collected through surveys administered to undergraduate students in computing programs across various National Capital Region (NCR) universities. The collected data was analyzed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) techniques to gain insights from the students responses. A word intrusion test assessed theme coherence, and evaluators demonstrated moderate agreement (Fleiss Kappa score: 0.62). The study reveals the benefits of employing ChatGPT for programming, including efficient coding, understanding complex codes, and its capability to be used as a problem-solving tool. However, it highlights critical issues and challenges, such as data privacy and ethical concerns, plagiarism tendencies, and contextual understanding limitations.

  abstract={With the increase in usage of machine learning models within many different aspects of customer interactions, it has become very clear that bias detection within associated customer interaction datasets has led to a critical focus on issues such as the identification of bias prior to model building, lack of understanding and transparency within models, and ultimately the prevention of biased predictions or classifications. This has never been more important since the introduction of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the associated rule of “right of explanation”. In this paper, we survey the state of the art for bias detection, avoidance and mitigation within datasets, and the associated methods and tools available. Our purpose is to establish an understanding of how established customer interaction-based use cases can utilise these techniques. The focus is primarily on tackling the bias in unstructured text data as a pre-process prior to the machine learning model training phase. We hope that this research encourages the further establishment of responsible usage of customer interaction datasets to allow the prevention of bias being introduced into machine learning pipelines and to also allow greater awareness of the potential for further research in this area.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are becoming common in our daily lives. The AI-driven processes significantly affect us as individuals and as a society, spanning across ethical dimensions like discrimination, misinformation, and fraud. Several of these AI & ML approaches rely on Knowledge Graph (KG) data. Due to the large volume and complexity of today's KG-driven approaches, enormous resources are spent to utilize the complex AI approaches. Efficient usage of the resources like hardware and power consumption is essential for sustainable KG-based ML technologies. This paper introduces the ethical and sustainability considerations, challenges, and optimizations in the context of KG-based ML. We have grouped the ethical and sustainability aspects according to the typical Research & Development (R&D) lifecycle: an initial investigation of the AI approach's responsibility dimensions; technical system setup; central KG data analytics and curating; model selection, training, and evaluation; and final technology deployment. We also describe significant trade-offs and alternative options for dedicated scenarios enriched through existing and reported ethical and sustainability issues in AI-driven approaches and research. These include, e.g., efficient hardware usage guidelines; or the trade-off between transparency and accessibility compared to the risk of manipulability and privacy-related data disclosure. In addition, we propose how biased data and barely explainable AI can result in discriminating ML predictions. This work supports researchers and developers in reflecting, evaluating, and optimizing dedicated KG-based ML approaches in the dimensions of ethics and sustainability.},

  abstract={Technology can play a key role in enabling the aged care system to provide better care for the older adults. In the past few years we have collaborated with several industry partners working in the field of aged care. Some of these operate and maintain aged care facilities, and some provide technological solutions to aged care providers. These collaborations involved extensive requirements elicitation to identify the needs of aged care residents, carers, clinical staff and facility administrators, on projects including mobile apps, data analysis, workforce training, and smart homes. Based on these, we have come up with a vision on a number of opportunities, and exposed many significant challenges, for requirements engineering in the aged care software domain that must be addressed. We summarise some of these requirements engineering challenges and a propose a vision with a framework to help address them in next-generation aged care software projects.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Global population aging has become an issue nowadays, which will eventually lead to a huge senior care market in the future. Currently, with the current senior care services and product, several critical issues exist which prevents seniors from getting care. The top reported problem includes the lack of professionals, overpriced services or products, insufficient attention to seniors’ mental needs, and insufficient government regulations. In this paper, a senior care ecosystem, named AīCare, was proposed to revolutionize the future senior care industry. The AīCare senior care ecosystem combined exponential technologies, such as IoT, robotics, and AI, to deliver affordable, reliable, and intelligent senior care services and products. The project was systematically planned and designed utilizing the Purpose Launchpad, coupled with business development tools provided by the Purpose Alliance. A low-fidelity prototype of this ecosystem was conceptualized as part of the innovation process. To substantiate the proposed hypotheses, two experimental cycles were implemented across China and Canada. The feedback acquired from these experiments continuously refines our ideas and directs the way for future development in this crucial sector. Our senior care ecosystem is not designed to entirely supplant the existing workforce of senior care professionals. Rather, our objective is to provide dependable and effective aids to complement their efforts, thereby enhancing their capability to cater to individuals requiring additional attention. This innovative approach intends to amplify the efficacy of current systems and contributes significantly towards the evolution of senior care, ultimately augmenting the quality-of-care provision.},

  pages={277-286},
  abstract={In this technologically evolving era, important human values such as freedom and social responsibility are frequently overlooked in software systems, which can have significant negative social consequences as can be seen by recent examples involving Facebook or Delta Airlines. Therefore, it is important to help software developers incorporate human values considerations throughout the software development process. In this paper, we focus on domain modelling with class diagrams, an important technique for requirements engineering and early design activities. We propose a domain-specific language called HVT (Human Value Trigger) that enables the collection of human value issues including how to mitigate them. Practitioners may utilize this language to contribute more such examples to grow a catalogue of these past experiences over time. As a motivating example, we analyze the domain model of WhatsApp through the lens of Schwartz's taxonomy of human values to compile a list of issues concerning human values (i.e., model elements that may affect various human values). Furthermore as proof-of-concept, a prototype implementation addresses the need for human values to be integrated in domain models with the help of these collected past experiences by providing suggestions based on the model element type, name, and semantics based on synonyms. An analysis of eight synonym services is performed to find the optimal synonym service or combination of synonym services to use with the implementation.},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},

  pages={45181-45193},
  abstract={The field of data visualisation has long aimed to devise solutions for generating visualisations directly from natural language text. Research in Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) has contributed towards the development of such techniques. However, the implementation of workable NLIs has always been challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language, as well as in consequence of unclear and poorly written user queries which pose problems for existing language models in discerning user intent. Instead of pursuing the usual path of developing new iterations of language models, this study uniquely proposes leveraging the advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-3 to convert free-form natural language directly into code for appropriate visualisations. This paper presents a novel system, Chat2VIS, which takes advantage of the capabilities of LLMs and demonstrates how, with effective prompt engineering, the complex problem of language understanding can be solved more efficiently, resulting in simpler and more accurate end-to-end solutions than prior approaches. Chat2VIS shows that LLMs together with the proposed prompts offer a reliable approach to rendering visualisations from natural language queries, even when queries are highly misspecified and underspecified. This solution also presents a significant reduction in costs for the development of NLI systems, while attaining greater visualisation inference abilities compared to traditional NLP approaches that use hand-crafted grammar rules and tailored models. This study also presents how LLM prompts can be constructed in a way that preserves data security and privacy while being generalisable to different datasets. This work compares the performance of GPT-3, Codex and ChatGPT across several case studies and contrasts the performances with prior studies.},

  abstract={We explore the inference of expressive human-readable declassification policies as a step towards providing practical tools and techniques for strong language-based information security. Security-type systems can enforce expressive information-security policies, but can require enormous programmer effort before any security benefit is realized. To reduce the burden on the programmer, we focus on inference of expressive yet intuitive information-security policies from programs with few programmer annotations. We define a novel security policy language that can express what information a program may release, under what conditions (or, when) such release may occur, and which procedures are involved with the release (or, where in the code the release occur). We describe a dataflow analysis for precisely inferring these policies, and build a tool that instantiates this analysis for the Java programming language. We validate the policies, analysis, and our implementation by applying the tool to a collection of simple Java programs.},

  abstract={Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have influenced almost every field including computer science, robotics, social engineering, psychology, criminology and so on. Although AI has solved various challenges, potential security threats of AI algorithms and training data have been stressed by AI researchers. As AI system inherits security threats of traditional computer system, the concern about novel cyberattack enhanced by AI is also growing. In addition, AI is deeply connected to physical space (e.g. autonomous vehicle, intelligent virtual assistant), so AI-related crime can harm people physically, beyond the cyberspace. In this context, we represent a literature review of security threats and AI-related crime. Based on the literature review, this article defines the term AI crime and classifies AI crime into 2 categories: AI as tool crime and AI as target crime, inspired by a taxonomy of cybercrime: Computer as tool crime and Computer as tool crime. Through the proposed taxonomy, foreseeable AI crimes are systematically studied and related forensic techniques are also addressed. We also analyze the characteristics of the AI crimes and present challenges that are difficult to be solved with the traditional forensic techniques. Finally, open issues are presented, with emphasis on the need to establish novel strategies for AI forensics.},

  abstract={With the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is confronting various healthcare issues, and healthcare automation is more crucial than ever. The pandemic has revealed the limitations of existing digital healthcare systems to manage public health emergencies. There is no registered population for many healthcare institutions in Sri Lanka, as a result, there is a communication gap. Electronic Health Record systems (EHRs) are becoming popular to share patient details but accessing scattered data across several EHRs while safeguarding patient privacy remains a challenge. Most of these medical records are in printed format and manually entering those into EHR systems is time-consuming and error prone. Not only that pharmaceutical error is a critical healthcare problem, but it is even riskier to visit doctors for pharmaceutical diagnosis during a pandemic. This research introduces a Blockchain-based patient health record system, an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) based Medical Document Scanner, a Drug Identifier based on Image Processing and a Medical Chatbot powered by NLP as four novel approaches to address these issues. Altogether with the results, this research aims at introducing a solution for the limitations in healthcare while providing a distributed healthcare framework for the healthcare community worldwide.},

  abstract={Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging architecture that enables flexible and easy management and communication of large-scale networks. It offers programmable and centralized interfaces for making complex network decisions dynamically and seamlessly. However, SDN provides opportunities for businesses and individuals to build network applications based on their demands and improve their services. In contrast, it started to face a new array of security and privacy challenges and simultaneously introduced the threats of a single point of failure. Usually, attackers launch malicious attacks such as botnets and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) to the controller through OpenFlow switches. Deep learning (DL)-based security applications are trending, effectively detecting and mitigating potential threats with fast response. In this article, we analyze and show the performance of the DL methods to detect botnet-based DDoS attacks in an SDN-supported environment. A newly self-generated dataset is used for the evaluation. We also used feature weighting and tuning methods to select the best subset of features. We verify the measurements and simulation outcomes over a self-generated dataset and real testbed settings. The main aim of this study is to find a lightweight DL method with baseline hyper-parameters to detect botnet-based DDoS attacks with features and data that can be easily acquired. We observed that the best subset of features influences the performance of the DL method, and the prediction accuracy of the same method could be variated with a different set of features. Finally, based on empirical results, we found that the CNN method outperforms the dataset and real testbed settings. The detection rate of CNN reaches 99% for normal flows and 97% for attack flows.},

  volume={},

  pages={1381-1394},
  abstract={On-device learning and efficient fine-tuning enable continuous and privacy-preserving customization (e.g., locally fine-tuning large language models on personalized data). However, existing training frameworks are designed for cloud servers with powerful accelerators (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) and lack the optimizations for learning on the edge, which faces challenges of resource limitations and edge hardware diversity. We introduce PockEngine: a tiny, sparse and efficient engine to enable fine-tuning on various edge devices. PockEngine supports sparse backpropagation: it prunes the backward graph and sparsely updates the model with measured memory saving and latency reduction while maintaining the model quality. Secondly, PockEngine is compilation first: the entire training graph (including forward, backward and optimization steps) is derived at compile-time, which reduces the runtime overhead and brings opportunities for graph transformations. PockEngine also integrates a rich set of training graph optimizations, thus can further accelerate the training cost, including operator reordering and backend switching. PockEngine supports diverse applications, frontends and hardware backends: it flexibly compiles and tunes models defined in PyTorch/TensorFlow/Jax and deploys binaries to mobile CPU/GPU/DSPs. We evaluated PockEngine on both vision models and large language models. PockEngine achieves up to 15 × speedup over off-the-shelf TensorFlow (Raspberry Pi), 5.6 memory saving back-propagation (Jetson AGX Orin). Remarkabl×y, PockEngine enables fine-tuning LLaMav2-7B on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin at 550 tokens/s, 7.9× faster than the PyTorch.CCS CONCEPTS• Computer systems organization → Neural networks.},

  abstract={With the advent of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the proliferation of deepfakes and the spread of m/disinformation have emerged as formidable threats to the integrity of information ecosystems worldwide. This paper provides an overview of the current literature. Within the frontier AI’s crucial application in developing defense mechanisms for detecting deepfakes, we highlight the mechanisms through which generative AI based on large models (LM-based GenAI) craft seemingly convincing yet fabricated contents. We explore the multifaceted implications of LM-based GenAI on society, politics, and individual privacy violations, underscoring the urgent need for robust defense strategies. To address these challenges, in this study, we introduce an integrated framework that combines advanced detection algorithms, cross-platform collaboration, and policy-driven initiatives to mitigate the risks associated with AI-Generated Content (AIGC). By leveraging multi-modal analysis, digital watermarking, and machine learning-based authentication techniques, we propose a defense mechanism adaptable to AI capabilities of ever-evolving nature. Furthermore, the paper advocates for a global consensus on the ethical usage of GenAI and implementing cyber-wellness educational programs to enhance public awareness and resilience against m/disinformation. Our findings suggest that a proactive and collaborative approach involving technological innovation and regulatory oversight is essential for safeguarding netizens while interacting with cyberspace against the insidious effects of deepfakes and GenAI-enabled m/disinformation campaigns.},

  abstract={Soft artificial intelligence (AI) is defined as non-sentient AI designed to perform close to human level in one specific domain. This is in contrast to “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI) which solves the problem for human level intelligence across all domains. Soft AI is a reality now in the new generation of smart Internet of Things devices like Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri or Microsoft's Cortana, giving rise to concerns about privacy and how the technology is being used. This research is based around an experiment in “AI as a service” where fifteen chatbot agents using Google's “Dialogflow” are deployed around the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London for the general public to interact with. The physical devices are 3D printed representations of creatures living in the park, designed to fit with the park's biodiversity remit. Park visitors interact with the creatures via their mobile phones, engaging in a conversation where the creature offers to tell them a memory in exchange for one of their own, while warning them that anything they say might be repeated to others. The scope of the work presented here is as follows. After explaining the details of the deployment and three month study, the conversational data collected from visitors is then analysed. Following a review of the current literature, techniques for working with the unstructured natural language data are developed, leading to recommendations for the design of future conversational “chatbot” agents. The results show distinct patterns of conversation, from simple and direct “verb plus noun” commands to complex sentence structure. How users interact with the agents, given that they are conversing with a mechanism, is discussed and contrasted with the memories that they have agreed to share. The conclusion drawn from this work is that, while the current generation of devices only listen for commands from users, there is a danger that smart IoT devices in the future can be used as active information probes unless properly understood and regulated. We finish with observations on privacy and security based on our experiences here.},

  abstract={Foreign language teaching, like almost all other aspects of human existence, has been substantially influenced by recent advances in modern information and communication technologies, such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence (AI). Although AI has been in use for almost 30 years, educators remain skeptical toward the use of AI-technology in the education field more broadly, and how its use might meaningfully affect English language skills. Through a systematic review, this work seeks to provide a summary of the available literature with regard to the applications of AI in English as a foreign language (EFL) education. This review considers a wide range of AI technologies and methodologies, with a specific focus on the integration of AI into the realm of EFL education. The review then delineates the possible effects of AI in terms of developing students' language skills, students' and teachers' perceptions of using AI applications, and the difficulties and challenges inherent to implementing AI applications. The discussion culminates by identifying research gaps.},

  abstract={A major challenge for Education 4.0 is to make use of wearable devices for helping students in monitoring their learning behavior and their activities (steps, heart rate variability, and heart rate) in real-time. The first aim of this paper is to present our implementation of adaptivity and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods within the Education 4.0 process. In this work, we investigate embedded biosensors (noninvasive, low-cost, and distraction-free) used in smartphones and smartwatches. The next objective is to enable IoT for Higher Education, i.e. a novel system assisted by AI that takes embedded biosensor data and environmental data into account in order to estimate students' wellbeing and health. In this regard, we propose a framework that uses wearable devices to collect data with biofeedback methods to support students' academic success.},

  abstract={Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models with low-footprint are increasingly being deployed on edge devices for conversational agents, which enhances privacy. We study the problem of federated continual incremental learning for recurrent neural network-transducer (RNN-T) ASR models in the privacy-enhancing scheme of learning on-device, without access to ground truth human transcripts or machine transcriptions from a stronger ASR model. In particular, we study the performance of a self-learning based scheme, with a paired teacher model updated through an exponential moving average of ASR models. Further, we propose using possibly noisy weak-supervision signals such as feedback scores and natural language understanding semantics determined from user behavior across multiple turns in a session of interactions with the conversational agent. These signals are leveraged in a multitask policy-gradient training approach to improve the performance of self-learning for ASR. Finally, we show how catastrophic forgetting can be mitigated by combining on-device learning with a memory-replay approach using selected historical datasets. These innovations allow for 10% relative improvement in WER on new use cases with minimal degradation on other test sets in the absence of strong-supervision signals such as ground-truth transcriptions.},

  abstract={Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ecumenical pandemic that has affected the whole world drastically by raising a global calamitous situation. Owing to this pernicious disease, millions of people have lost their lives. The scientists are still far from knowing how to tackle the coronavirus due to its multiple mutations found around the globe. The standard testing technique called polymerase chain reaction for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 is expensive and time consuming. However, to assist specialists and radiologists in COVID-19 detection and diagnosis, deep learning plays an important role. Many research efforts have been done that leverage deep learning techniques and technologies for the identification or categorization of COVID-19-positive patients, and these techniques are proved to be a powerful tool that can automatically detect or diagnose COVID-19 cases. In this article, we identify significant challenges regarding deep-learning-based systems and techniques that use different medical imaging modalities, including cough and breadth, chest X-ray, and computed tomography, to combat COVID-19 outbreak. We also pinpoint important research questions for each category of challenges.},

  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={95060-95078},
  abstract={This paper introduces a novel method for translating natural-language instructions into executable robot actions using OpenAI’s ChatGPT in a few-shot setting. We propose customizable input prompts for ChatGPT that can easily integrate with robot execution systems or visual recognition programs, adapt to various environments, and create multi-step task plans while mitigating the impact of token limit imposed on ChatGPT. In our approach, ChatGPT receives both instructions and textual environmental data, and outputs a task plan and an updated environment. These environmental data are reused in subsequent task planning, thus eliminating the extensive record-keeping of prior task plans within the prompts of ChatGPT. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of these prompts across various domestic environments, such as manipulations in front of a shelf, a fridge, and a drawer. The conversational capability of ChatGPT allows users to adjust the output via natural-language feedback. Additionally, a quantitative evaluation using VirtualHome showed that our results are comparable to previous studies. Specifically, 36% of task planning met both executability and correctness, and the rate approached 100% after several rounds of feedback. Our experiments revealed that ChatGPT can reasonably plan tasks and estimate post-operation environments without actual experience in object manipulation. Despite the allure of ChatGPT-based task planning in robotics, a standardized methodology remains elusive, making our work a substantial contribution. These prompts can serve as customizable templates, offering practical resources for the robotics research community. Our prompts and source code are open source and publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/ChatGPT-Robot-Manipulation-Prompts.},

  abstract={Mental health problems are on the rise globally and strain national health systems worldwide. Mental disorders are closely associated with fear of stigma, structural barriers such as financial burden, and lack of available services and resources which often prohibit the delivery of frequent clinical advice and monitoring. Technologies for mental well-being exhibit a range of attractive properties, which facilitate the delivery of state-of-the-art clinical monitoring. This review article provides an overview of traditional techniques followed by their technological alternatives, sensing devices, behaviour changing tools, and feedback interfaces. The challenges presented by these technologies are then discussed with data collection, privacy, and battery life being some of the key issues which need to be carefully considered for the successful deployment of mental health toolkits. Finally, the opportunities this growing research area presents are discussed including the use of portable tangible interfaces combining sensing and feedback technologies. Capitalising on the data these ubiquitous devices can record, state of the art machine learning algorithms can lead to the development of robust clinical decision support tools towards diagnosis and improvement of mental well-being delivery in real-time.},

But most of it are paid, if it is of free then the content provided is not a satisfiable one to get the language entirely. In order to provide a useful and beneficial learning for free of cost we proposed a way with the utilization of Artificial Intelligence. A website is developed with the Artificial Intelligence to monitor the performance of the peoples who enrolled in it. Website is developed on game based for bringing interest to learn the language. There are multiple levels to be unlocked with interesting challenges and question solving. By this, peoples start to develop their English knowledge with cracking the levels. Here the Artificial Intelligence play a major role in building the question set and the level difficulty for each individual while crossing each level. This is done by analysing the marks obtained in each level. The database is stored and then fed into the Artificial Intelligence model to make evaluation of the individual performance. According the analysis made by the intelligence the level difficulty is set up. So, by this the individual stats to understand the meaning and usage of the word in each scenario. Compare to the proposed methodologies of existing website there is no such involvement of Artificial Intelligence for the analysis making and for building the levels. This era has a lot of development in the technologies with the Artificial Intelligence. Working with Artificial Intelligence make each individual to be strong and confident in their domain. This website will develop the individual to become confident person on speaking with the English language.},

  volume={11},

  pages={38805-38818},
  abstract={ChatGPT has sparked both excitement and skepticism in education. To analyze its impact on teaching and learning it is crucial to understand how students perceive ChatGPT and assess its potential and challenges. Toward this, we conducted a two-stage study with senior students in a computer engineering program ( $n=56$ ). In the first stage, we asked the students to evaluate ChatGPT using their own words after they used it to complete one learning activity. The returned responses (3136 words) were analyzed by coding and theme building (36 codes and 15 themes). In the second stage, we used the derived codes and themes to create a 27-item questionnaire. The students responded to this questionnaire three weeks later after completing other activities with the help of ChatGPT. The results show that the students admire the capabilities of ChatGPT and find it interesting, motivating, and helpful for study and work. They find it easy to use and appreciate its human-like interface that provides well-structured responses and good explanations. However, many students feel that ChatGPT’s answers are not always accurate and most of them believe that it requires good background knowledge to work with since it does not replace human intelligence. So, most students think that ChatGPT needs to be improved but are optimistic that this will happen soon. When it comes to the negative impact of ChatGPT on learning, academic integrity, jobs, and life, the students are divided. We conclude that ChatGPT can and should be used for learning. However, students should be aware of its limitations. Educators should try using ChatGPT and guide students on effective prompting techniques and how to assess generated responses. The developers should improve their models to enhance the accuracy of given answers. The study provides insights into the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in education and informs future research and development.},

  abstract={Botnets continue to evolve despite many efforts by law enforcement agencies and security researchers. As a result, there is an increase in the number of cybercrimes. This has led to a greater research focus on botnet detection. Among the reasons for growth in botnet and cybercrimes despite greater research focus are that significant number of the proposed techniques are not reproducible (unavailability of source code), do not contain a detailed description for effective comparison, and the absence of a real world labeled dataset for effective comparison. There is a grave problem of the unavailability of the labeled real-world dataset for bot infection detection. This paper aims to create a public labeled real-world Domain Name System (DNS) dataset for bot infection detection. The dataset contains real world DNS traffic of benign and malicious hosts. The dataset containing 24 features is labeled to list infected Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) hosts along with the botnet family name and the DGA domains used for C&C communication. A total of 7644 hosts were found infected with nine different botnets namely modpack, virut, necurs, conficker, ud3, suppobox, nymain, tofsee and pitou. Finally, a machine learning classifier is developed to distinguish DGA bots from normal hosts using these features with an accuracy of 99.59%.},

  abstract={With the fast-growing popularity of online social networks (OSN), maintaining the security of OSN ecosystems becomes essential for the public. Among all the security threats facing OSN, malicious social bots have become the most common and detrimental. These bot programs are often employed to violate users' privacy, distribute spam, and disturb the financial market, posing a compelling need for effective social bot detection solutions. Unlike traditional bot detection approaches that have strict requirements on data sources (e.g., private payload information, social relationships, or activity histories), this paper proposes a detection method called BotFlowMon that relies only on NetFlow data as input to identify OSN bot traffic, where every NetFlow record is a summary of a traffic flow on the Internet and contains no payload content. BotFlowMon introduces several new algorithms and techniques to help use machine learning to classify the social bot traffic from the real OSN user traffic, including aggregating NetFlow records to obtain transaction data, fusing transaction data to extract features and visualize flows, as well as subdividing transactions into basic actions. Our evaluation shows that with 535GB raw NetFlow records as input, BotFlowMon can efficiently classify the traffic from social bots, including chatbot, amplification bot, post bot, crawler bot, and hybrid bot, with 92.33-93.61 % accuracy.},

  abstract={This paper aims to study anonymous communication strategy in the Telegram. Telegram is a new cloud-messenger that is highly popular among bloggers and media in Russia and Belarus. Established by Pavel Durov in 2013, it offers secure and anonymous communication features. Anonymous communication has been studied by many scholars (Choudhury, Sharon, Watt, Zhang, etc), but it seems that more questions are left unanswered. This paper starts distinguishing anonymity from related notions of confidentiality and secrecy, privacy, and publicity. We provide some vocabulary to talk about anonymization and identification efforts by message sources and receivers. The paper highlights some of the limitations of current communication scholarship in this area such as anonymous communication strategy. The growing role of the Telegram messenger in the mass communications systems of Russia and Belarus indicates new opportunities for anonymous communication strategy in the digital society. The research methodology is based on a comparative analysis of statistical data on the audience of the leading Telegram news channels. The authors argue that the anonymous communication strategy has taken an important share of the market in both countries. In a comparative aspect, the indicators of the involvement of Telegram channels were analyzed. The main results of the study show that the use of various Telegram features both as a messenger and as a full-fledged media is constantly increasing. The intensity of the use of the messenger has increased and the variety of functions it performs has also increased. It has been established that the Telegram platform contributes to strengthening feedback from the audience. Chatbots have become a new opportunity to receive information from readers. The authors conclude that alternative Telegram channels play an important role in the digital environment.},

  abstract={Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA’s) have been employed by botnet orchestrators for controlling infected hosts (bots), while evading detection by performing multiple DNS requests, mostly for non-existing domain names. With blacklists ineffective, modern DGA filtering methods rely on Machine Learning (ML). Emerging needs for higher intrusion detection accuracy lead to complex, non-interpretable black-box classifiers, thus requiring eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques. In this paper, we utilize SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) to derive model-agnostic, post-hoc interpretations on DGA name classifiers. This method is applied to binary supervised tree-based classifiers (e.g. eXtreme Gradient Boosting - XGBoost) and deep neural networks (Multi-Layer Perceptron - MLP) to assess domain name feature importance. SHAP visualization tools (summary, dependence, force plots) are used to rank features, investigate their effect on model decisions and determine their interactions. Specific interpretations are detailed for identifying names belonging to common DGA families pertaining to arithmetic, wordlist, hash and permutation based schemes. Learning and interpretations are based on up-to-date datasets, such as Tranco for benign and DGArchive for malicious names. Domain name features are extracted from dataset instances, thus limiting time-consuming and privacy-invasive database operations on historical data. Our experimental results demonstrate that SHAP enables explanations of XGBoost (the most accurate tree-based model) and MLP classifiers and indicates the characteristics of specific DGA schemes, commonly employed in attacks. In conclusion, we envision that XAI methods will expedite ML deployment in networking environments where justifications for black-box models are required.},

  abstract={The primary goal of the paper is to examine the applications and integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in the realm of social media. AI has greatly influenced how organizations approach their marketing efforts on social platforms. By analyzing large volumes of data and making predictions, AI enables companies to target their advertising and content more effectively towards specific audiences. This utilization of AI in social media allows businesses to understand consumers' perspectives, emotions, and reactions to brands and products, ultimately reaching a larger number of people. Moreover, the adoption of AI has improved companies' efficiency, logistical networks, reduced expenses, and increased revenues by 10%. Additionally, AI plays a crucial role in safeguarding user data privacy and contributes to the profitability of businesses utilizing social media marketing with AI. Nevertheless, while AI simplifies various tasks in the social media domain, relying solely on AI for these functions may not be advisable. Hence, this study suggests thoroughly examining the implications of AI in digital marketing and social media advertising, covering all aspects. One key area where AI has a significant impact is personalization. By analyzing customer data, AI algorithms can identify patterns and preferences, allowing marketers to customize their messaging to specific target audiences. This leads to higher engagement rates and more successful social media campaigns. However, the increasing use of successfully showcase by distinguishing designs and trends. AI chatbots can moreover be utilized for client bolster and social engagement, whereas AI-generated substance can be custom-made to particular audiences for social media creation and detailing. In spite of the benefits of AI within the promoting industry, there are concerns almost security, security and straightforwardness. Pundits say the utilize of AI in social media can lead to “bubbles” in which clients display data that as it were underpins their convictions and opinions. The reason of this audit is to look at the affect of commerce insights in trade and its applications within the media, centering on the strengths and impediments of past investigate in this region. Particularly, we are going investigate the current applications of AI within the publicizing industry and the dangers and benefits related with the technology.We have moreover looked into existing investigate on this subject, highlighting the most discoveries and impedimentsof past considers. At last, based on the investigation of the current circumstance, we make suggestions for assist inquire about in this range. Fake insights (AI) incorporates the improvement of brilliantly computers that can perform errands already saved for people (Smith, 2018), [1]. Its fundamental reason is to utilize machines to perform errands that require considering, perception, examination, choice making and basic artificial intelligence in the business sector also raises ethical questions. There is a risk that AI algorithms may promote or create biases that can lead to discrimination or exclusion of certain groups.},
