10.1145/3625469.3625483,AI Chatbots in Social Media: Ethical Responsibilities and Privacy Challenges of Information and Communication Technology,"In recent years, the pervasive integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots into social media platforms has transformed the way individuals communicate and access information. This paper aims to critically examine the ethical responsibilities and privacy challenges associated with the application of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in AI chatbots within social media environments. The purpose of this investigation is to highlight the complexities surrounding the implementation of chatbots and understand the implications of ICT with regards to ethical and privacy concerns. The study addresses the adoption of AI chatbots for varied applications such as customer support, content moderation, and personalized advertising. The central focus is on how ICT can inadvertently contribute to potential ethical dilemmas, including data bias, transparency, accountability, and privacy breaches. Moreover, the paper explores the existing regulatory frameworks governing the use of AI chatbots and recommends a set of best practices for ensuring ethical compliance and safeguarding user privacy. By evaluating the interplay between AI chatbots and ICT, this research offers valuable insights into the responsibilities and challenges that need to be considered to foster a more ethical and privacy-conscious implementation of AI chatbots in social media.","Liu, Yage",,Proceedings of the 2023 6th International Conference on Information Management and Management Science,2023,10.1145/3625469.3625483,https://doi.org/10.1145/3625469.3625483,acm.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:40,Unclassified
10.1145/3461778.3462143,“I wrote as if I were telling a story to someone I knew.”: Designing Chatbot Interactions for Expressive Writing in Mental Health,"Writing about experiences of trauma and other challenges in life is known to provide measurable health benefits. Though writing for an audience may ensure better benefits, confiding one's most troubled memories in others risks a social stigma. Conversational agents can provide a virtual audience that ensures privacy and allows social disclosure. To understand the writing experience with an agent, we created Diarybot, a chatbot assistant for expressive writing. We designed two versions, Basic and Responsive, to explore the writing experience with and without bot follow-up interactions compared to a Google doc baseline. Findings from a 4-day user study with 30 participants reveal that social disclosure with Diarybot can encourage narrative writing, with relative ease and emotional expression in Basic chat. Responsive chat can mediate social acceptance of the bot and provide guidance for self-reflection in the process. We discuss design reflections on social disclosure with agents in pursuit of wellbeing.","Park, SoHyun and Thieme, Anja and Han, Jeongyun and Lee, Sungwoo and Rhee, Wonjong and Suh, Bongwon",,Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference,2021,10.1145/3461778.3462143,https://doi.org/10.1145/3461778.3462143,acm.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:40,Unclassified
10.1145/3472301.3484358,Posthumous data at stake: An Overview of Digital Immortality Issues,"Who wants to be immortal? While this rhetorical question seems to haunt humans, digital immortality is already a reality. Social networks have allowed and facilitated our digital footprints to remain forever at reach of Internet users. We will all die, on the other hand, our digital self may remain forever. Social media technology has also allowed people to browse or even post messages to maintain the memory of a person alive. It seems spooky, but it is technically feasible to build a chatbot from a deceased person's digital legacy allowing a certain degree of presence of a deceased. This unaware digital immortality brings new cultural, technical, social, ethical, and legal challenges and implications that should be brought to light and discussed. There is an urge to recognize the limits for an adequate use of digital immortality. By means of an overview, this paper reports our literature survey where we identified some key issues regarding digital immortality, looking at the benefits, consequences and complications from its use. Our study identified differences when dealing with famous versus non-famous deceased, explicitly defined public versus private data, right and duties related to data preservation versus deletion, technological advances versus restrictions, cultural impedance, and differences from the reasons for desiring immortalization. With this article, we aim to encourage discussions on digital immortality, its current limits and points that need to be considered regarding such a sensitive theme that is already a current issue.","Galv\~{a}o, Vinicius Ferreira and Maciel, Cristiano and Pereira, Vinicius Carvalho and Garcia, Ana Cristina Bicharra and Pereira, Roberto and Viterbo, Jos\'{e}",,Proceedings of the XX Brazilian Symposium on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2021,10.1145/3472301.3484358,https://doi.org/10.1145/3472301.3484358,acm.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:40,Unclassified

For e-commerce search systems, understanding natural language coming through voice assistants, chatbots or from conversational search is an essential ability to understand what the user really wants. However, evaluation datasets with natural and detailed information needs of product-seekers which could be used for research do not exist. Due to privacy issues and competitive consequences, only few datasets with real user search queries from logs are openly available. In this paper, we present a dataset of 3,540 natural language queries in two domains that describe what users want when searching for a laptop or a jacket of their choice. The dataset contains annotations of vague terms and key facts of 1,754 laptop queries. This dataset opens up a range of research opportunities in the fields of natural language processing and (interactive) information retrieval for product search.","Papenmeier, Andrea and Kern, Dagmar and Hienert, Daniel and Sliwa, Alfred and Aker, Ahmet and Fuhr, Norbert",,Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval,2021,10.1145/3406522.3446043,https://doi.org/10.1145/3406522.3446043,acm.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:40,Unclassified

The development of large language models and generative AI has elevated natural language processing to the level that it can output coherent and contextually relevant text for a given natural language prompt. ChatGPT is one incarnation of these steps, and its use in education is a rather new phenomenon. In this paper, we study students’ perception on ChatGPT during a computer science course. On the course, we integrated ChatGPT into Teams private discussion groups. In addition, all the students had freedom to employ ChatGPT and related technologies to help them in their coursework. The results show that the majority of students had at least tested AI-powered chatbots, and that students are using AI-powered chatbots for multiple tasks, e.g., debugging code, tutoring, and enhancing comprehension. The amount of positive implications of using ChatGPT takes over the negative implications, when the implications were considered from an understanding, learning and creativity perspective. Relatively many students reported reliability issues with the outputs and that the iterations with prompts might be necessary for satisfactory outputs. It is important to try to steer the usage of ChatGPT so that it complements students’ learning processes, but does not replace it.","Rajala, Jaakko and Hukkanen, Jenni and Hartikainen, Maria and Niemel\""{a}, Pia",,Proceedings of the 26th International Academic Mindtrek Conference,2023,10.1145/3616961.3616974,https://doi.org/10.1145/3616961.3616974,acm.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:40,Unclassified
10386087,Saving the Day for Users in Web Platforms: A Chatbot-based Solution for Privacy,"In the rapidly evolving online digital landscape, privacy is an issue of great importance for individuals, while the use of web platforms handling personal data has reached significant levels. Regulations like the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enforce systems to integrate an array of privacy features allowing users to exercise their privacy rights and shield their personal data. However, users tend to find themselves overwhelmed or even ignorant, unsure of how to locate and use them. Research also showed that users find privacy policies hard to read and tend to skip them. This work introduces a novel approach to addressing these privacy concerns by presenting a user-centric solution to enhancing user privacy in web platforms and empowering users in handling their own personal data: an easy-to-use chatbot-based solution. The tool aims to provide a user-friendly and intuitive all-in-one interface, allowing users to easily navigate and access privacy features and manage their personal data while retrieving information about privacy aspects effortlessly from one location.

10271802,"Security Risks, User Privacy Risks, and a Trust Framework for the Metaverse Space","The Metaverse is an incredible 3D virtual reality experience that anyone worldwide can access. It is a digital space not limited by geography, and it is made up of interconnected systems with unique rules and capabilities. The best thing about the Metaverse is that it allows people to interact with others in an environment that they might not have been able to visit otherwise. It is a perfect way to immerse oneself in other domains, such as entertainment and education, and it is also a great way to collaborate on projects with people worldwide. However, it is essential to note that the trustworthiness of the data collected from the disparate systems for the Metaverse needs to be studied in some areas. Trust is a significant issue in the Metaverse because users will interact with each other and virtual objects in a fully immersive environment. Security risks are also to consider, such as the attack surface that contributes to integrating various cutting-edge technology in the Metaverse. Additionally, the immersive workplace metaverse is subject to privacy risks to the users. Therefore, exploring the Metaverse’s security, privacy, and trust components is crucial to assist in research in these emerging areas. This research paper defines the trust framework and goals for Metaverse space, which are the key ingredients that ensure users use the products or services to buy, renew, and continue to trust their data. It is essential to address the trust issues to ensure the Metaverse is a safe, secure, and trustworthy experience for all users.","Kharvi, Prakash Laxman",,"2023 IEEE International Conference on Metaverse Computing, Networking and Applications (MetaCom)",2023,10.1109/MetaCom57706.2023.00033,,ieee.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:40,Unclassified
10253855,HCPP: A Data-Oriented Framework to Preserve Privacy during Interactions with Healthcare Chatbot,"Healthcare chatbots are becoming increasingly popular, but with their use comes the issues of excessive personal information collection and privacy leakage. To address this issue, we propose a Healthcare Chatbot-based Privacy Preserving (HCPP) Framework that adopts a data-oriented approach to reduce the excessive disclosure of personal information. HCPP consists of two main components: the Healthcare Chatbot-based Minimized Personal Information (HCMPI) method and the Healthcare Chatbot-based Zero Knowledge Proof (HCZKP) method. HCMPI leverages large language models (LLMs) to minimize the acquisition of unnecessary personal health information without significantly affecting healthcare service. HCZKP further encrypts a part of the minimized information, making the data available but invisible. The experimental evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our approach.","Cai, Ziyan and Chang, Xin and Li, Ping",,"2023 IEEE International Performance, Computing, and Communications Conference (IPCCC)",2023,10.1109/IPCCC59175.2023.10253855,,ieee.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:40,Unclassified
10320174,Security and Privacy Perceptions of Mental Health Chatbots,"Mental health chatbots are AI chatbots that aim to mimic human conversations about how a user feels, help a user work through issues they are facing, suggest wellness exercises to complete, and help track a user’s mood over time. We compare the information disclosure practices and security and privacy concerns of adopters and non-adopters of mental health chatbots. We conducted a survey with 180 participants (30 adopters, 150 non-adopters), collecting data about what information they would hypothetically disclose to mental health chatbots, and concerns they had related to chatbots. We found that compared to non-adopters, adopters were more trusting of chatbots, were willing to reveal more information, perceived security and privacy risks to be less likely, and took fewer precautions.","Chametka, Paulina and Maqsood, Sana and Chiasson, Sonia",,"2023 20th Annual International Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST)",2023,10.1109/PST58708.2023.10320174,,ieee.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:40,Unclassified

10178747,A Chatbot-based Recommendation Framework for Hypertensive Patients,"Chatbot-based systems are recognised in literature as an effective tool to support chronic diseases self-management. However, the core of most of this work is on the description of the application domain and on the motivations behind the adoption of recommendation systems that exploit chatbot to mediate the interaction with users, but they fail in providing sufficient details on the system architecture and on the technology adopted. Moreover, they are usually designed with a strong focus on the specific pathology, and a reference architectural solution that can be adopted in different contexts is missing, thus making the work useful only in the domain it is devised for. In this paper we provide a framework for developing recommendation systems based on chatbots that is meant to be applied in different scenarios. The framework is composed by a back-end recommendation engine that autonomously computes the user's adherence profile to prescription, and proactively provides motivational feedback to the user through the application front-end based on a chatbot. The chatbot is also meant to collect and aggregate data for profiling the individual health and habits. To demonstrate the feasibility of our framework, we present a recommendation system, based on a Telegram chatbot, that has been developed and trained for managing hypertensive patients.","Montagna, Sara and Mariani, Stefano and Pengo, Martino Francesco",,2023 IEEE 36th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS),2023,10.1109/CBMS58004.2023.00309,,ieee.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:40,Unclassified

Yet cyber risks related to technology are well known. In previous works, three different layers were defined to be responsible of the cyber physical security of any given system: the network layer, the device layer and the human factor layer. However, statistics and experience have proven that the third factor is the weakest link in the cyber security of any company. This factor is divided into two subsections: the ignorance of the user (which will be treated in this paper) and the malignancy of the user. As the two previous layers were presented in previous works, this paper will focus on enhancing security by raising the cyber awareness of users thus creating a human firewall. For that, an AI-based conversational bot that focuses on cyber threat awareness and acts as a personal assistant relating to security issues was developed.

10368930,A Fuzzy Logic and NLP Approach to Emotion Driven Response Generation for Voice Interaction,"The voice modality has become the most prominent channel in the rapidly emerging field of human-computer interactions. Emotional connection is the foundation of successful communication. Our words are enhanced in human-to-human interactions by emotional undertones, vocal specifics, and contextual interpretations. When correctly interpreted, these hidden signals open the door to empathy, understanding, and effective communication. However, this emotional depth is not addressed in human computer verbal interactions. The challenge is comparable to having a conversation in which the words are understood but the feelings are not. Our idea focuses on bridging this emotional divide. We introduce an innovative approach to human-computer vocal interactions using a blend of advanced Natural Language Processing and Fuzzy Logic-based Voice Sentiment Analysis. Because human emotions are naturally complex, we use fuzzy logic to extract nuanced sentiment scores from voice inputs. Both the content, which is obtained from NLP, and the tone, which is modified to either mirror or contradict the detected sentiment, are informed by these evaluations in the form of voice. This bonds people with AI not only through words but also through emotions. Such a system has broad applications, from emotionally intelligent virtual assistants to support lines and teletherapy solutions. By ensuring AI can not only understand but also respond aptly to human emotion, bringing AI one step closer to reality.","M, Gopika Sri and G, Karthiga and K, Jayakarthika and N, Ilakkiya and V, Lavanyagayathri and D, Uma Mageswari S",,"2023 International Conference on Research Methodologies in Knowledge Management, Artificial Intelligence and Telecommunication Engineering (RMKMATE)",2023,10.1109/RMKMATE59243.2023.10368930,,ieee.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:40,Unclassified

There are several success stories which vouch for usage of RPA, at the same time, there are some key aspects to be taken care in terms of security to minimize problems with the RPA. RPA automates a process, reducing human intervention and involvement. So, many expect it increases security by default. It should be noted, automation doesn’t mean it ensures security and compliance of the process by default. It's important to note that the method of RPA can often be quite risky in some cases. This is because RPA bots will handle sensitive data and transmitting it across systems associated with the business for various processes. So, if the sensitive data is not secured in right manner, it might get exposed, which can impact the business. So, while considering RPA, an organization should make sure it understands the security implications to the business process.

So the chatbot will be made secure using the techniques of authentication (session) timeout and encryption. ""Encryption is a method of secure communication that prevents others from accessing data while it is being transferred from one end system to another. The data is encrypted on the sender’s system, so only the intended recipient can decrypt it. "" Authentication (session) timeout restricts a time limit on how long an authenticated user can stay ""logged in,"" so this prevents cyber criminals from having enough time to predict their way into somebody’s secured account.

9530938,Cyber Security Risk Analysis for a Virtual Assistant G2C Digital Service Using FAIR Model,"During development and deployment of Government-to-Citizen (G2C) e-services, stakeholders must take cybersecurity risks into account. Recently, Estonia proposed a novel e-service delivery through the use of virtual assistants. Cybersecurity is important to any organization due to the prevalence of attacks in recent times. Organizations in both the public sector and private sector typically have a program that determines, calculates and treats risks. These programs are identified as “risk management,” and cybersecurity risk assessment and analysis are a key part of these organizations. When correctly implemented, these programs can help decision makers allocate their cyber defense budgets in a more effective manner.The researchers conducted interviews with seven cybersecurity experts discussing cybersecurity data, metrics and risk assessment and analysis methods. These interviews informed the use of the Open Group’s Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) model in this paper.Because Estonia is one of the first countries in the world to prioritize e-service development in this domain, there is a literature gap pertaining to cybersecurity risk analyses of virtual assistant enabled e-services. Although a multiplicity of methods exist for risk assessment and analysis, this research follows the FAIR method to assess a G2C e-service which uses a third party provider for an Amazon Alexa skill that has become corrupted due to malware infection. The FAIR method projects the risk for a particular vulnerability in terms of dollar amount loss over time. It states the annualized loss exposure in terms of a minimum loss, a maximum loss, and a most likely amount of loss.Aggregated global public sector cyber breach frequency data was taken from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse database and loss magnitude data was taken from the Cyentia IRIS 2020 report which utilized the Advisen cyber loss database. Based upon a Project Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) distribution Monte Carlo simulation of this data, the annualized loss exposure projection for the public sector entity was $0 minimum likely value, most likely value $70,500 and maximum likely value of $6,000,000. Future work proposes more country and organization specific data for FAIR methodology use for G2C virtual assistant e-services analysis. The value of the work is that it shows how public sector agencies could use the FAIR model to make their cybersecurity risk models more quantitative than is generally currently practiced even in cases of new types of developments and services in order to aid decision-makers in allocation of funding to better defend against the most impactful risks.","Dreyling, Richard and Jackson, Eric and Pappel, Ingrid",,2021 Eighth International Conference on eDemocracy & eGovernment (ICEDEG),2021,10.1109/ICEDEG52154.2021.9530938,,ieee.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:40,Unclassified

Ad targeting explanations have been proposed as a way to reduce this concern by improving transparency. However, it is unclear when and why people might want ad targeting explanations. Without this insight, we run the risk of designing explanations that do not address real concerns. To bridge this gap, we conducted a four-week, mixed-methods field study with 60 participants to understand when and why people want targeting explanations for the ads they actually encountered while browsing the web. We found that users wanted explanations for around 30% of the 4,251 ads we asked them about during the study, and that subjective perceptions of how their personal data was collected and shared were highly correlated with when users wanted ad explanations. Often, users wanted these explanations to confirm or deny their own preconceptions about how their data was collected or the motives of advertisers. A key upshot of our work is that one-size-fits-all approaches to ad explanations are likely to fail at addressing people’s lived concerns about ad targeting; instead, more personalized explanations are needed.","Lee, Hao-Ping Hank and Logas, Jacob and Yang, Stephanie and Li, Zhouyu and Barbosa, Natã and Wang, Yang and Das, Sauvik",,2023 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP),2023,10.1109/SP46215.2023.10179452,,ieee.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:40,Unclassified

9308962,"Towards Learning-Based, Content-Agnostic Detection of Social Bot Traffic","With the fast-growing popularity of online social networks (OSNs), the security and privacy of OSN ecosystems becomes essential for the public. Among threats OSNs face, malicious social bots have become the most common and detrimental. They are often employed to violate users’ privacy, distribute spam, and disturb the financial market, posing a compelling need for effective social bot detection solutions. Unlike traditional social bot detection approaches that have strict requirements on data sources (e.g., private payload information, social relationships, or activity histories), this article proposes a method called BotFlowMon that relies only on content-agnostic flow-level data as input to identify OSN bot traffic. BotFlowMon introduces several new algorithms and techniques to classify social bot traffic from real OSN user traffic, including aggregating network flow records to obtain OSN transaction data, fusing transaction data to extract features and visualize flows, and an innovative density-valley-based clustering algorithm to subdivide each transaction into individual actions. The evaluation shows BotFlowMon can identify the traffic from social bots with a 96.1 percent accuracy, which, based on the worst case study on a testing machine, only takes no more than 0.71 seconds on average after it sees the traffic.","Feng, Yebo and Li, Jun and Jiao, Lei and Wu, Xintao",IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,,2021,10.1109/TDSC.2020.3047399,,ieee.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:40,Unclassified

However, in-depth validation of the solely synthetic data setting has yet to be conducted, despite the increased possibility of models trained exclusively on fully synthetic data emerging in the future. Therefore, we examined the question, “Do data quality control techniques (known to positively impact data-centric AI) consistently aid models trained exclusively on synthetic datasets?”. To explore this query, we performed detailed analyses using synthetic datasets generated for speech recognition postprocessing using the BackTranScription (BTS) approach. Our study primarily addressed the potential adverse effects of data quality control measures (e.g., noise injection and balanced data) and training strategies in the context of synthetic-only experiments.

Like other AIs, SASs are also known to have unstable behavior when subjected to changes in data which can make them problematic to trust out of concerns like bias when AI works with humans and data has protected attributes like gender, race, and age. Recently, an approach was introduced to assess SASs in a blackbox setting without training data or code, and rating them for bias using synthetic English data. We augment it by introducing two human-generated chatbot datasets and also considering a round-trip setting of translating the data from one language to the same through an intermediate language. We find that these settings show SASs performance in a more realistic light. Specifically, we find that rating SASs on the chatbot data showed more bias compared to the synthetic data, and round-tripping using Spanish and Danish as intermediate languages reduces the bias (up to 68% reduction) in human-generated data while, in synthetic data, it takes a surprising turn by increasing the bias!

10268594,An Overview on Generative AI at Scale With Edge–Cloud Computing,"As a specific category of artificial intelligence (AI), generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) generates new content that resembles what humans create. The rapid development of GenAI systems has created a huge amount of new data on the Internet, posing new challenges to current computing and communication frameworks. Currently, GenAI services rely on the traditional cloud computing framework due to the need for large computation resources. However, such services will encounter high latency because of data transmission and a high volume of user requests. On the other hand, edge-cloud computing can provide adequate computation power and low latency at the same time through the collaboration between edges and the cloud. Thus, it is attractive to build GenAI systems at scale by leveraging the edge-cloud computing paradigm. In this overview paper, we review recent developments in GenAI and edge-cloud computing, respectively. Then, we use two exemplary GenAI applications to discuss technical challenges in scaling up their solutions using edge-cloud collaborative systems. Finally, we list design considerations for training and deploying GenAI systems at scale and point out future research directions.","Wang, Yun-Cheng and Xue, Jintang and Wei, Chengwei and Kuo, C. -C.

The AI-driven processes significantly affect us as individuals and as a society, spanning across ethical dimensions like discrimination, misinformation, and fraud. Several of these AI & ML approaches rely on Knowledge Graph (KG) data. Due to the large volume and complexity of today's KG-driven approaches, enormous resources are spent to utilize the complex AI approaches. Efficient usage of the resources like hardware and power consumption is essential for sustainable KG-based ML technologies. This paper introduces the ethical and sustainability considerations, challenges, and optimizations in the context of KG-based ML. We have grouped the ethical and sustainability aspects according to the typical Research & Development (R&D) lifecycle: an initial investigation of the AI approach's responsibility dimensions; technical system setup; central KG data analytics and curating; model selection, training, and evaluation; and final technology deployment. We also describe significant trade-offs and alternative options for dedicated scenarios enriched through existing and reported ethical and sustainability issues in AI-driven approaches and research. These include, e.g., efficient hardware usage guidelines; or the trade-off between transparency and accessibility compared to the risk of manipulability and privacy-related data disclosure.

Currently, with the current senior care services and product, several critical issues exist which prevents seniors from getting care. The top reported problem includes the lack of professionals, overpriced services or products, insufficient attention to seniors’ mental needs, and insufficient government regulations. In this paper, a senior care ecosystem, named AīCare, was proposed to revolutionize the future senior care industry. The AīCare senior care ecosystem combined exponential technologies, such as IoT, robotics, and AI, to deliver affordable, reliable, and intelligent senior care services and products. The project was systematically planned and designed utilizing the Purpose Launchpad, coupled with business development tools provided by the Purpose Alliance. A low-fidelity prototype of this ecosystem was conceptualized as part of the innovation process. To substantiate the proposed hypotheses, two experimental cycles were implemented across China and Canada. The feedback acquired from these experiments continuously refines our ideas and directs the way for future development in this crucial sector. Our senior care ecosystem is not designed to entirely supplant the existing workforce of senior care professionals. Rather, our objective is to provide dependable and effective aids to complement their efforts, thereby enhancing their capability to cater to individuals requiring additional attention.

Therefore, it is important to help software developers incorporate human values considerations throughout the software development process. In this paper, we focus on domain modelling with class diagrams, an important technique for requirements engineering and early design activities. We propose a domain-specific language called HVT (Human Value Trigger) that enables the collection of human value issues including how to mitigate them. Practitioners may utilize this language to contribute more such examples to grow a catalogue of these past experiences over time. As a motivating example, we analyze the domain model of WhatsApp through the lens of Schwartz's taxonomy of human values to compile a list of issues concerning human values (i.e., model elements that may affect various human values). Furthermore as proof-of-concept, a prototype implementation addresses the need for human values to be integrated in domain models with the help of these collected past experiences by providing suggestions based on the model element type, name, and semantics based on synonyms.

10121440,"Chat2VIS: Generating Data Visualizations via Natural Language Using ChatGPT, Codex and GPT-3 Large Language Models","The field of data visualisation has long aimed to devise solutions for generating visualisations directly from natural language text. Research in Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) has contributed towards the development of such techniques. However, the implementation of workable NLIs has always been challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language, as well as in consequence of unclear and poorly written user queries which pose problems for existing language models in discerning user intent. Instead of pursuing the usual path of developing new iterations of language models, this study uniquely proposes leveraging the advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-3 to convert free-form natural language directly into code for appropriate visualisations. This paper presents a novel system, Chat2VIS, which takes advantage of the capabilities of LLMs and demonstrates how, with effective prompt engineering, the complex problem of language understanding can be solved more efficiently, resulting in simpler and more accurate end-to-end solutions than prior approaches. Chat2VIS shows that LLMs together with the proposed prompts offer a reliable approach to rendering visualisations from natural language queries, even when queries are highly misspecified and underspecified. This solution also presents a significant reduction in costs for the development of NLI systems, while attaining greater visualisation inference abilities compared to traditional NLP approaches that use hand-crafted grammar rules and tailored models. This study also presents how LLM prompts can be constructed in a way that preserves data security and privacy while being generalisable to different datasets. This work compares the performance of GPT-3, Codex and ChatGPT across several case studies and contrasts the performances with prior studies.","Maddigan, Paula and Susnjak, Teo",IEEE Access,,2023,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3274199,,ieee.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:40,Unclassified

To reduce the burden on the programmer, we focus on inference of expressive yet intuitive information-security policies from programs with few programmer annotations. We define a novel security policy language that can express what information a program may release, under what conditions (or, when) such release may occur, and which procedures are involved with the release (or, where in the code the release occur). We describe a dataflow analysis for precisely inferring these policies, and build a tool that instantiates this analysis for the Java programming language.

It offers programmable and centralized interfaces for making complex network decisions dynamically and seamlessly. However, SDN provides opportunities for businesses and individuals to build network applications based on their demands and improve their services. In contrast, it started to face a new array of security and privacy challenges and simultaneously introduced the threats of a single point of failure. Usually, attackers launch malicious attacks such as botnets and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) to the controller through OpenFlow switches. Deep learning (DL)-based security applications are trending, effectively detecting and mitigating potential threats with fast response. In this article, we analyze and show the performance of the DL methods to detect botnet-based DDoS attacks in an SDN-supported environment. A newly self-generated dataset is used for the evaluation. We also used feature weighting and tuning methods to select the best subset of features. We verify the measurements and simulation outcomes over a self-generated dataset and real testbed settings. The main aim of this study is to find a lightweight DL method with baseline hyper-parameters to detect botnet-based DDoS attacks with features and data that can be easily acquired. We observed that the best subset of features influences the performance of the DL method, and the prediction accuracy of the same method could be variated with a different set of features.

10411395,PockEngine: Sparse and Efficient Fine-tuning in a Pocket,"On-device learning and efficient fine-tuning enable continuous and privacy-preserving customization (e.g., locally fine-tuning large language models on personalized data). However, existing training frameworks are designed for cloud servers with powerful accelerators (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) and lack the optimizations for learning on the edge, which faces challenges of resource limitations and edge hardware diversity. We introduce PockEngine: a tiny, sparse and efficient engine to enable fine-tuning on various edge devices. PockEngine supports sparse backpropagation: it prunes the backward graph and sparsely updates the model with measured memory saving and latency reduction while maintaining the model quality. Secondly, PockEngine is compilation first: the entire training graph (including forward, backward and optimization steps) is derived at compile-time, which reduces the runtime overhead and brings opportunities for graph transformations. PockEngine also integrates a rich set of training graph optimizations, thus can further accelerate the training cost, including operator reordering and backend switching. PockEngine supports diverse applications, frontends and hardware backends: it flexibly compiles and tunes models defined in PyTorch/TensorFlow/Jax and deploys binaries to mobile CPU/GPU/DSPs. We evaluated PockEngine on both vision models and large language models. PockEngine achieves up to 15 × speedup over off-the-shelf TensorFlow (Raspberry Pi), 5.6 memory saving back-propagation (Jetson AGX Orin). Remarkabl×y, PockEngine enables fine-tuning LLaMav2-7B on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin at 550 tokens/s, 7.9× faster than the PyTorch.CCS CONCEPTS• Computer systems organization → Neural networks.","Zhu, Ligeng and Hu, Lanxiang and Lin, Ji and Wang, Wei-Chen and Chen, Wei-Ming and Gan, Chuang and Han, Song",,2023 56th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO),2023,,,ieee.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:40,Unclassified

Within the frontier AI’s crucial application in developing defense mechanisms for detecting deepfakes, we highlight the mechanisms through which generative AI based on large models (LM-based GenAI) craft seemingly convincing yet fabricated contents. We explore the multifaceted implications of LM-based GenAI on society, politics, and individual privacy violations, underscoring the urgent need for robust defense strategies. To address these challenges, in this study, we introduce an integrated framework that combines advanced detection algorithms, cross-platform collaboration, and policy-driven initiatives to mitigate the risks associated with AI-Generated Content (AIGC). By leveraging multi-modal analysis, digital watermarking, and machine learning-based authentication techniques, we propose a defense mechanism adaptable to AI capabilities of ever-evolving nature. Furthermore, the paper advocates for a global consensus on the ethical usage of GenAI and implementing cyber-wellness educational programs to enhance public awareness and resilience against m/disinformation. Our findings suggest that a proactive and collaborative approach involving technological innovation and regulatory oversight is essential for safeguarding netizens while interacting with cyberspace against the insidious effects of deepfakes and GenAI-enabled m/disinformation campaigns.","Shoaib, Mohamed R. and Wang, Zefan and Ahvanooey, Milad Taleby and Zhao, Jun",,2023 International Conference on Computer and Applications (ICCA),2023,10.1109/ICCA59364.2023.10401723,,ieee.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:40,Unclassified

10096983,Federated Self-Learning with Weak Supervision for Speech Recognition,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models with low-footprint are increasingly being deployed on edge devices for conversational agents, which enhances privacy. We study the problem of federated continual incremental learning for recurrent neural network-transducer (RNN-T) ASR models in the privacy-enhancing scheme of learning on-device, without access to ground truth human transcripts or machine transcriptions from a stronger ASR model. In particular, we study the performance of a self-learning based scheme, with a paired teacher model updated through an exponential moving average of ASR models. Further, we propose using possibly noisy weak-supervision signals such as feedback scores and natural language understanding semantics determined from user behavior across multiple turns in a session of interactions with the conversational agent. These signals are leveraged in a multitask policy-gradient training approach to improve the performance of self-learning for ASR. Finally, we show how catastrophic forgetting can be mitigated by combining on-device learning with a memory-replay approach using selected historical datasets. These innovations allow for 10% relative improvement in WER on new use cases with minimal degradation on other test sets in the absence of strong-supervision signals such as ground-truth transcriptions.","Rao, Milind and Chennupati, Gopinath and Tiwari, Gautam and Kumar Sahu, Anit and Raju, Anirudh and Rastrow, Ariya and Droppo, Jasha",,"ICASSP 2023 - 2023 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",2023,10.1109/ICASSP49357.2023.10096983,,ieee.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:40,Unclassified

10235949,ChatGPT Empowered Long-Step Robot Control in Various Environments: A Case Application,"This paper introduces a novel method for translating natural-language instructions into executable robot actions using OpenAI’s ChatGPT in a few-shot setting. We propose customizable input prompts for ChatGPT that can easily integrate with robot execution systems or visual recognition programs, adapt to various environments, and create multi-step task plans while mitigating the impact of token limit imposed on ChatGPT. In our approach, ChatGPT receives both instructions and textual environmental data, and outputs a task plan and an updated environment. These environmental data are reused in subsequent task planning, thus eliminating the extensive record-keeping of prior task plans within the prompts of ChatGPT. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of these prompts across various domestic environments, such as manipulations in front of a shelf, a fridge, and a drawer. The conversational capability of ChatGPT allows users to adjust the output via natural-language feedback. Additionally, a quantitative evaluation using VirtualHome showed that our results are comparable to previous studies. Specifically, 36% of task planning met both executability and correctness, and the rate approached 100% after several rounds of feedback. Our experiments revealed that ChatGPT can reasonably plan tasks and estimate post-operation environments without actual experience in object manipulation. Despite the allure of ChatGPT-based task planning in robotics, a standardized methodology remains elusive, making our work a substantial contribution. These prompts can serve as customizable templates, offering practical resources for the robotics research community.

10105236,Exploring Students’ Perceptions of ChatGPT: Thematic Analysis and Follow-Up Survey,"ChatGPT has sparked both excitement and skepticism in education. To analyze its impact on teaching and learning it is crucial to understand how students perceive ChatGPT and assess its potential and challenges. Toward this, we conducted a two-stage study with senior students in a computer engineering program ( $n=56$ ). In the first stage, we asked the students to evaluate ChatGPT using their own words after they used it to complete one learning activity. The returned responses (3136 words) were analyzed by coding and theme building (36 codes and 15 themes). In the second stage, we used the derived codes and themes to create a 27-item questionnaire. The students responded to this questionnaire three weeks later after completing other activities with the help of ChatGPT. The results show that the students admire the capabilities of ChatGPT and find it interesting, motivating, and helpful for study and work. They find it easy to use and appreciate its human-like interface that provides well-structured responses and good explanations. However, many students feel that ChatGPT’s answers are not always accurate and most of them believe that it requires good background knowledge to work with since it does not replace human intelligence. So, most students think that ChatGPT needs to be improved but are optimistic that this will happen soon. When it comes to the negative impact of ChatGPT on learning, academic integrity, jobs, and life, the students are divided. We conclude that ChatGPT can and should be used for learning. However, students should be aware of its limitations. Educators should try using ChatGPT and guide students on effective prompting techniques and how to assess generated responses. The developers should improve their models to enhance the accuracy of given answers. The study provides insights into the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in education and informs future research and development.","Shoufan, Abdulhadi",IEEE Access,,2023,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3268224,,ieee.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:40,Unclassified

With blacklists ineffective, modern DGA filtering methods rely on Machine Learning (ML). Emerging needs for higher intrusion detection accuracy lead to complex, non-interpretable black-box classifiers, thus requiring eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques. In this paper, we utilize SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) to derive model-agnostic, post-hoc interpretations on DGA name classifiers. This method is applied to binary supervised tree-based classifiers (e.g. eXtreme Gradient Boosting - XGBoost) and deep neural networks (Multi-Layer Perceptron - MLP) to assess domain name feature importance. SHAP visualization tools (summary, dependence, force plots) are used to rank features, investigate their effect on model decisions and determine their interactions. Specific interpretations are detailed for identifying names belonging to common DGA families pertaining to arithmetic, wordlist, hash and permutation based schemes. Learning and interpretations are based on up-to-date datasets, such as Tranco for benign and DGArchive for malicious names. Domain name features are extracted from dataset instances, thus limiting time-consuming and privacy-invasive database operations on historical data. Our experimental results demonstrate that SHAP enables explanations of XGBoost (the most accurate tree-based model) and MLP classifiers and indicates the characteristics of specific DGA schemes, commonly employed in attacks. In conclusion, we envision that XAI methods will expedite ML deployment in networking environments where justifications for black-box models are required.","Kostopoulos, Nikos and Kalogeras, Dimitris and Pantazatos, Dimitris and Grammatikou, Maria and Maglaris, Vasilis",IEEE Access,,2023,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3286313,,ieee.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:40,Unclassified

Foosherian202356,Enhancing Pipeline-Based Conversational Agents with Large Language Models,"The latest advancements in AI and deep learning have led to a breakthrough in large language model (LLM)-based agents such as GPT- 4. However, many commercial conversational agent development tools are pipeline-based and have limitations in holding a human-like conversation. This paper investigates the capabilities of LLMs to enhance pipeline-based conversational agents during two phases: 1) in the design and development phase and 2) during operations. In 1) LLMs can aid in generating training data, extracting entities and synonyms, localization, and persona design. In 2) LLMs can assist in contextualization, intent classification to prevent conversational breakdown and handle out-of-scope questions, auto-correcting utterances, rephrasing responses, formulating disambiguation questions, summarization, and enabling closed question-answering capabilities. We conducted informal experiments with GPT-4 in the private banking domain to demonstrate the scenarios above with a practical example. Companies may be hesitant to replace their pipeline-based agents with LLMs entirely due to privacy concerns and the need for deep integration within their existing ecosystems.

Augusma2023750,Multimodal Group Emotion Recognition In-the-wild Using Privacy-Compliant Features,"This paper explores privacy-compliant group-level emotion recognition ""in-the-wild""within the EmotiW Challenge 2023. Group-level emotion recognition can be useful in many fields including social robotics, conversational agents, e-coaching and learning analytics. This research imposes itself using only global features avoiding individual ones, i.e. all features that can be used to identify or track people in videos (facial landmarks, body poses, audio diarization, etc.). The proposed multimodal model is composed of a video and an audio branches with a cross-attention between modalities. The video branch is based on a fine-tuned ViT architecture. The audio branch extracts Mel-spectrograms and feed them through CNN blocks into a transformer encoder. Our training paradigm includes a generated synthetic dataset to increase the sensitivity of our model on facial expression within the image in a data-driven way. The extensive experiments show the significance of our methodology. Our privacy-compliant proposal performs fairly on the EmotiW challenge, with 79.24% and 75.13% of accuracy respectively on validation and test set for the best models. Noticeably, our findings highlight that it is possible to reach this accuracy level with privacy-compliant features using only 5 frames uniformly distributed on the video.  © 2023 ACM.","Augusma, Anderson and Vaufreydaz, Dominique and Letué, Frédérique",ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,,2023,10.1145/3577190.3616546,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85175837394&doi=10.1145%2f3577190.3616546&partnerID=40&md5=ff0997c06e2749420cc3465ddf1433ea,scopus.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:41,Unclassified
Galatzer-Levy2023228,Can Mental Health Care Become More Human by Becoming More Digital?,"Over the past two decades, advances in digital technologies have begun to transform three aspects of mental health care. The use of sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) have provided new, objective measures of how we think, feel, and behave. The ease of connecting and communicating remotely has transformed the brick-and-mortar practice of mental health care into a telehealth service, increasing access and convenience for both patients and providers. And the advent of digital therapeutics, from virtual reality for treating phobias to conversational agents for delivering structured therapies, promises to alter how treatments will be delivered in the future. These digital transformations can help to solve many of the key challenges facing mental health care, including access, quality, and accountability. But digital technology introduces a new set of challenges around trust, privacy, and equity. Despite high levels of investment and promotion, there remain profound questions about efficacy and safety of digital mental health technologies. We share our experiences from the front lines creating digital innovations for mental health, with a focus on what a digital transformation of care could deliver for millions with a serious mental illness. © 2023 by Isaac R.

THE CASE OF CHATBOTS IN THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT, IN THE CONTEXT OF COVID-19; [PREOCUPACIONES ÉTICAS EN EL USO DE INTELIGENCIA ARTIFICIAL, TRANSPARENCIA Y DERECHO DE ACCESO A LA INFORMACIÓN. EL CASO DE LOS CHATBOTS EN EL GOBIERNO DE MÉXICO, EN EL CONTEXTO DE LA COVID-19]","The use of artificial intelligence in governments has increased in the last decade in several countries, acquiring greater importance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Chatbots are one of the main tools that work based on artificial intelligence and have been used by governments to provide information and ser-vices to citizens, as well as for the follow-up, monitoring, and control of COVID-19. The use of these tools has generated ethical debates on the use of personal data, privacy, transparency, accountability, and the right of access to information. The objective of this work is to identify and analyze the main ethical concerns that emerge around the chatbots implemented in the mexican government in the context of COVID-19; the cases of Susana Distancia and Dr. Armando Vaccuno are analyzed. The methodology consists of an open survey of citizen perception. The results show that the main ethical concerns are transparency, accountability, and privacy, which have generated a lack of trust on the part of citizens towards chatbots, that have resulted in a low level of use. To remedy this, it is necessary to eliminate the regulatory gaps around transparency and data protection involved in these modern technologies. © 2023, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

Vervier2023213,Perception of Privacy and Willingness to Share Personal Data in the Smart Factory,"By optimising data-driven processes and improving automation, the digital transformation in production aims to increase effectiveness, efficiency and improve the working conditions of employees. In such a networked working environment, the performance and actions of workers need to be captured in form of digital data. However, the collection of personal data is a sensitive issue. More research, not only from a techno-centric but also from a human-centric perspective, is needed. Using a multi-method approach, this study examines the motives, barriers and acceptance of technologies that use personal data in a production context. A qualitative pre-study (n= 7 ) identified motives (e.g. data offering personal benefit) and barriers (e.g. privacy concerns) of personal data disclosure. In the subsequent quantitative main study (n= 152 ), these key elements were operationalised in a scenario-based online survey, and two different working scenarios – cobot and chatbot – were additionally assessed using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM and UTAUT2). The results show: The more fun it is to use and the higher the expected performance, the higher the acceptance of technology using personal data. Trust in automation followed by expected effort were important. Views on the disclosure of personal data and the expected benefit to the organisation varied widely. Out of seven categories, work-related and demographic data were considered to be disclosable, while five categories were considered important to the organisation. The article concludes with actionable recommendations on how the collection and use of personal data can be well aligned with stakeholder interests. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Vervier, Luisa and Brauner, Philipp and Ziefle, Martina",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,2023,10.1007/978-3-031-35822-7_15,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171420795&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-35822-7_15&partnerID=40&md5=5461603947048cddf4ccdf4866f2b0f3,scopus.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:41,Unclassified

Leschanowsky2023296,Privacy Strategies for Conversational AI and their Influence on Users' Perceptions and Decision-Making,"Conversational AI (CAI) systems are on the rise and have been widely adopted in homes, cars and public spaces. Yet, people report privacy concerns and mistrust in these systems. Current data protection regulations ask providers to communicate data practices transparently and provide users with options to control their data. However, even if users are given control, their decisions can be subject to heuristics and biases leaving people frustrated and regretful. Based on the idea of conversational privacy and debiasing, we design three privacy strategies for CAI that allow people to have their data deleted while at the same time promoting rational decision-making. We conduct a user study to test our strategies in two widespread scenarios using a text-based CAI system and evaluate their impact on peoples' privacy perception, usability and attitude-behaviour alignment. We find that our strategies can significantly change people's behaviour, but do not influence peoples' privacy perception. Finally, we discuss evaluation metrics and future research directions to investigate privacy controls in Conversational AI systems. © 2023 Owner/Author.","Leschanowsky, Anna and Popp, Birgit and Peters, Nils",ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,,2023,10.1145/3617072.3617106,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85175400905&doi=10.1145%2f3617072.3617106&partnerID=40&md5=4de3c303d16c8fada2fa816b4931b0ea,scopus.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:41,Unclassified

Guleria20231292,ChatGPT: ethical concerns and challenges in academics and research,"Introduction: The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has presented several opportunities to ease human work. AI applications are available for almost every domain of life. A new technology, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), was introduced by OpenAI in November 2022, and has become a topic of discussion across the world. ChatGPT-3 has brought many opportunities, as well as ethical and privacy considerations. ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM) which has been trained on the events that happened until 2021. The use of AI and its assisted technologies in scientific writing is against research and publication ethics. Therefore, policies and guidelines need to be developed over the use of such tools in scientific writing. The main objective of the present study was to highlight the use of AI and AI assisted technologies such as the ChatGPT and other chatbots in the scientific writing and in the research domain resulting in bias, spread of inaccurate information and plagiarism. Methodology: Experiments were designed to test the accuracy of ChatGPT when used in research and academic writing. Results: The information provided by ChatGPT was inaccurate and may have far-reaching implications in the field of medical science and engineering. Critical thinking should be encouraged among researchers to raise awareness about the associated privacy and ethical risks. Conclusions: Regulations for ethical and privacy concerns related to the use of ChatGPT in academics and research need to be developed.

Lu202342,Developing Responsible Chatbots for Financial Services: A Pattern-Oriented Responsible Artificial Intelligence Engineering Approach,"The recent release of ChatGPT has gained huge attention and discussion worldwide, with responsible artificial intelligence (RAI) being a crucial topic of discussion. One key question is, ""How can we ensure that AI systems, like ChatGPT, are developed and adopted in a responsible way?""To tackle RAI challenges, various ethical principles have been released by governments, organizations, and companies. However, those principles are very abstract and not practical enough. Further, significant efforts have been put on algorithm-level solutions that only address a narrow set of principles, such as fairness and privacy. To fill the gap, we adopt a pattern-oriented RAI engineering approach and build an RAI pattern catalog to operationalize RAI from a system perspective. In this article, we first summarize the major challenges in operationalizing RAI at scale and introduce how we use the RAI pattern catalog to address those challenges. We then examine the risks at each stage of the chatbot development process and recommend pattern-driven mitigations to evaluate the usefulness of the RAI pattern catalog in a real-world setting.  © 2001-2011 IEEE.","Lu, Qinghua and Luo, Yuxiu and Zhu, Liming and Tang, Mingjian and Xu, Xiwei and Whittle, Jon",IEEE Intelligent Systems,,2023,10.1109/MIS.2023.3320437,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165127803&doi=10.1109%2fMIS.2023.3320437&partnerID=40&md5=8315036640a9c833c146ede69c0be028,scopus.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:41,Unclassified
Kayalı202320,Investigation of student experiences with ChatGPT-supported online learning applications in higher education,"The purpose of this study was to determine university students' experiences with the use of ChatGPT in online courses. The sample consisted of 84 associate degree students from a state university in Turkey. A multi-method approach was used in the study. Although quantitative data were collected using the Chatbot Usability Scale, qualitative data were collected using a semi-structured interview form that we developed. The data were analysed using descriptive and content analysis methods. According to the findings, ChatGPT exhibits advantages such as a user-friendly interface and fast, concise, relevant responses. Moreover, emphasizing its contribution to the learning process, the information provided was sufficient and topic-oriented. The understandability of the chatbot’s functions and the clarity of their communication were emphasized. However, there are disadvantages such as performance issues, frequency of errors and the risk of providing misleading information. Concerns have also been raised about the potential difficulties chatbots may face in ambiguous conversations and providing insufficient information on privacy issues. In conclusion, ChatGPT is recognised as a potentially valuable tool in education based on positive usability impressions; however, more research is needed for its safe use. Implications for practice or policy • Based on positive usability impressions, students and instructors can use ChatGPT to support educational activities. • ChatGPT can promote and enhance students' personalised learning experiences. • ChatGPT can be used in all higher education courses. • Users should be cautious about the accuracy and reliability of the answers provided by ChatGPT. • Decision-makers should take precautions against risks such as privacy, ethics, confidentiality and security that may arise from using artificial intelligence in education. © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

Martinengo2023,"Conversational Agents in Health Care: Expert Interviews to Inform the Definition, Classification, and Conceptual Framework","Background: Conversational agents (CAs), or chatbots, are computer programs that simulate conversations with humans. The use of CAs in health care settings is recent and rapidly increasing, which often translates to poor reporting of the CA development and evaluation processes and unreliable research findings. We developed and published a conceptual framework, designing, developing, evaluating, and implementing a smartphone-delivered, rule-based conversational agent (DISCOVER), consisting of 3 iterative stages of CA design, development, and evaluation and implementation, complemented by 2 cross-cutting themes (user-centered design and data privacy and security). Objective: This study aims to perform in-depth, semistructured interviews with multidisciplinary experts in health care CAs to share their views on the definition and classification of health care CAs and evaluate and validate the DISCOVER conceptual framework. Methods: We conducted one-on-one semistructured interviews via Zoom (Zoom Video Communications) with 12 multidisciplinary CA experts using an interview guide based on our framework. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed by the research team, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Following participants’ input, we defined CAs as digital interfaces that use natural language to engage in a synchronous dialogue using ≥1 communication modality, such as text, voice, images, or video. CAs were classified by 13 categories: response generation method, input and output modalities, CA purpose, deployment platform, CA development modality, appearance, length of interaction, type of CA-user interaction, dialogue initiation, communication style, CA personality, human support, and type of health care intervention. Experts considered that the conceptual framework could be adapted for artificial intelligence–based CAs. However, despite recent advances in artificial intelligence, including large language models, the technology is not able to ensure safety and reliability in health care settings. Finally, aligned with participants’ feedback, we present an updated iteration of the conceptual framework for health care conversational agents (CHAT) with key considerations for CA design, development, and evaluation and implementation, complemented by 3 cross-cutting themes: ethics, user involvement, and data privacy and security. Conclusions: We present an expanded, validated CHAT and aim at guiding researchers from a variety of backgrounds and with different levels of expertise in the design, development, and evaluation and implementation of rule-based CAs in health care settings. © 2023 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Huallpa2023105,Exploring the ethical considerations of using Chat GPT in university education,"This study investigates the moral dilemmas that arise with incorporating Chat GPT into higher education, with a focus on the situation in Latinoamerican institutions of higher learning. The study surveyed 220 people via online questionnaire to learn more about their experiences with and motivations for using AI-powered conversational agents. An overview of the demographics of the participants was provided through descriptive statistics. This investigation of the subject at hand lays the groundwork for further research. It also reveals the hidden meanings of the observed phenomena, and it suggests possible solutions to the problems that have been uncovered. This research looks at how AI systems and chatbots can supplement human knowledge and judgment, as well as their potential drawbacks. The results showed that participants thought Chat GPT integration was moderately accessible and had moderately positive social attitudes. They understood the value and responsibility of Chat GPT in creating individualized educational opportunities. Participants stressed the necessity for explicit institutional standards regarding privacy and data security. Gender, age, sense of accessibility, social attitude, opinions, and personal experience, privacy and data security, institutional guidelines, and individualized learning were also found to affect participants' reliance on AI through regression analysis. The findings shed light on how the integration of Chat GPT into Latinoamerican higher education is complicated by factors such as individual beliefs, cultural norms, and ethical problems. The busy schedules of students may be accommodated and the resources they need to succeed can be made available thanks to this adaptability. In addition, natural language processing models can offer students instantaneous help via text chat, voice, or video. To fully grasp the ethical consequences and lead the creation of responsible implementation techniques, the research proposes that additional qualitative investigations, longitudinal studies, and comparative research across diverse contexts is required. Closing these knowledge gaps will help move the conversational AI field forward in ways that are ethical and beneficial to the classroom. © The Author 2023.

Gallent-Iglesias202387,IVAMED: Intelligent Virtual Assistant for Medical Diagnosis,"The recent advancements in deep learning have led to a myriad of approaches for medical diagnosis and assistance. Some topics such as data labelling, data curation, human-in-the-loop, explainability or privacy-preserving methodologies are hot topics for applied machine learning in the healthcare context. In this domain, we normally expect a three-way interaction (doctor-system-patient), so that interfaces play a crucial role. Remotely managed VR (Virtual Reality) systems help us to enhance communication and feedback between doctors and patients in situations where in-person assistance is not feasible. Moreover, the recent breakthroughs with LLMs (Large Language Models) enable us to use natural language as additional interface, considering NLU (Natural Language Understanding) for intent recognition, ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and TTS (Text-To-Speech). In the context of the CEL.IA network, we present IVAMED (Intelligent Virtual Assistant for MEdical Diagnosis), a chatbot-oriented application in a VR environment for remote medical assistance. We tackle the situation in which face-to-face assistance is not possible. We provide the tools for remote interaction and guided diagnosis. We propose the evaluation of the MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) test for early detection of MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) and the BDI (Beck Depression Inventory) test for measuring characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression.  © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Gallent-Iglesias, Dana and Serantes-Raposo, Santiago and López-Riobóo-Botana, Iñigo and Gonzalez-Vázquez, Sonia and Fernandez-Graña, Pablo Manuel",CEUR Workshop Proceedings,,2023,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176449982&partnerID=40&md5=f13871392a1efa004ad463ee109f239f,scopus.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:41,Unclassified

Moore2024,Investigating the Potential of a Conversational Agent (Phyllis) to Support Adolescent Health and Overcome Barriers to Physical Activity: Co-Design Study,"Background: Conversational agents (CAs) are a promising solution to support people in improving physical activity (PA) behaviors. However, there is a lack of CAs targeted at adolescents that aim to provide support to overcome barriers to PA. This study reports the results of the co-design, development, and evaluation of a prototype CA called “Phyllis” to support adolescents in overcoming barriers to PA with the aim of improving PA behaviors. The study presents one of the first theory-driven CAs that use existing research, a theoretical framework, and a behavior change model. Objective: The aim of the study is to use a mixed methods approach to investigate the potential of a CA to support adolescents in overcoming barriers to PA and enhance their confidence and motivation to engage in PA. Methods: The methodology involved co-designing with 8 adolescents to create a relational and persuasive CA with a suitable persona and dialogue. The CA was evaluated to determine its acceptability, usability, and effectiveness, with 46 adolescents participating in the study via a web-based survey. Results: The co-design participants were students aged 11 to 13 years, with a sex distribution of 56% (5/9) female and 44% (4/9) male, representing diverse ethnic backgrounds. Participants reported 37 specific barriers to PA, and the most common barriers included a “lack of confidence,” “fear of failure,” and a “lack of motivation.” The CA’s persona, named “Phyllis,” was co-designed with input from the students, reflecting their preferences for a friendly, understanding, and intelligent personality. Users engaged in 61 conversations with Phyllis and reported a positive user experience, and 73% of them expressed a definite intention to use the fully functional CA in the future, with a net promoter score indicating a high likelihood of recommendation. Phyllis also performed well, being able to recognize a range of different barriers to PA. The CA’s persuasive capacity was evaluated in modules focusing on confidence and motivation, with a significant increase in students’ agreement in feeling confident and motivated to engage in PA after interacting with Phyllis. Adolescents also expect to have a personalized experience and be able to personalize all aspects of the CA. Conclusions: The results showed high acceptability and a positive user experience, indicating the CA’s potential. Promising outcomes were observed, with increasing confidence and motivation for PA. Further research and development are needed to create further interventions to address other barriers to PA and assess long-term behavior change. Addressing concerns regarding bias and privacy is crucial for achieving acceptability in the future. The CA’s potential extends to health care systems and multimodal support, providing valuable insights for designing digital health interventions including tackling global inactivity issues among adolescents. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

Seckelmann20231,Artificial intelligence in administration: The draft of a European AI Regulation and the handling of information technology risks; [KüNSTLICHE INTELLIGENZ IN DER VERWALTUNG Der Entwurf einer europäischen KI-Verordnung und der Umgang mit informationstechnischen Risiken],"Applications of artificially intelligent systems have recently enjoyed increasing popularity, as demonstrated in particular by the presentation of the chatbot ""ChatGPT"" by the AI research company OpenAI. ChatGPT also demonstrates the potential of AI more generally: Such applications can already be used by private individuals, for example to get support in writing exams or theses, and it seems likely that one day similar AI systems, such as chatbots, could also be used in public administration. This does, nevertheless raise some questions in the public administrative sector: predictive decisions, involving the need for careful risk evaluation, are not new to German administrative law, as is apparent from fields like atomic energy law. Still, it is questionable how far the administration should entrust such procedures of probabilistic risk analysis to AI applications and to what extent this could be legally acceptable? The analysis in this paper is devoted to answering this question. Part II begins by clarifying some of the key concepts underpinning the notion of artificial intelligence, including 'digitalisation', 'algorithms', 'big data analytics' and 'machine learning'. The different (supervised and unsupervised) methods of machine learning are considered, as are their modes of operation and selected problems they raise, such as the possibility of bias and lack of transparency and comprehensibility. Part III then examines in detail the European Commission's draft regulation on AI (Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised Rules on Artificial Intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act), COM(2021) 206 final, 2021/0106 (COD)). This legislative initiative pursues in particular the goal of regulating AI applications and harmonising the regulations on them across the Union. The regulatory scope as well as the area of application and the contents of the draft AI regulation are first shown and possible deficits are discussed. A problematic aspect is the systematic relationship of the draft regulation to other existing EU regulatory acts, such as the General Data Protection Regulation and its Art. 22 GDPR. Following on from the discussion of these problematic aspects, Part IV presents the current draft status of the AI Regulation as well as analysing the (critical) reaction, especially of the Federal Republic of Germany, to the same. PartVconcludes by assessing the implications of the above for use of AI systems in the German public administration, and provides a final evaluation of the draft AI regulation in the latter context. A key issue remains how far it is acceptable for AI-predictions, based on the behavior of a class of persons, to be applied to individual citizens. © 2023 Duncker und Humblot GmbH.

Adam2023,From web forms to chatbots: The roles of consistency and reciprocity for user information disclosure,"Interactive decision aids (IDAs) on websites often require users to disclose relevant information (e.g., preferences, contact information) to help users in making decisions (e.g., product choice). With technological advances in IDAs, websites increasingly switch from static, non-conversational IDAs (e.g., web forms) to conversational ones (e.g., chatbots) to boost user information disclosure that nurtures the websites' economic viability. While this novel form of IDAs is already widely employed in practice, information systems research has yet to examine the defining dialogue design features of conversational IDAs and their effects on eliciting user information. Drawing on persuasion theory and particularly on consistency and reciprocity as influence techniques, we develop a research model around two crucial dialogue design features of conversational IDAs. Specifically, we investigate the distinct and joint effects of conversational style (i.e., absence vs. presence of a conversational presentation of requests) and reciprocation triggers (i.e., absence vs. presence of reciprocity-inducing information) on user information disclosure (i.e., email addresses). By combining the complementary properties of a randomised field experiment (N = 386) and a follow-up online experiment (N = 182), we empirically provide evidence in support of the distinct and joint effects of conversational style and reciprocation triggers of IDAs on user information disclosure. Moreover, we demonstrate that these dialogue design features have indirect effects on information disclosure via perceptions of social presence and privacy concerns. Thus, our paper provides theoretical and practical insights into whether, how, and why critical IDA dialogue design features can better elicit user information for website services. © 2023 The Authors.

characteristics and features, user backgrounds, communication models,
relational building capacity, personalization, interaction, responses to
suicidal thoughts, and users' in-app experiences during chatbot use.
Through this analysis, we seek to identify gaps in the current research,
guide future directions, and enhance the design of health-focused
chatbots. Methods: Following the scoping review methodology by Arksey
and O'Malley and guided by the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews)
checklist, this study used a two-pronged approach to identify relevant
chatbots: (1) searching the iOS and Android App Stores and (2) reviewing
scientific literature through a search strategy designed by a librarian.
Overall, 36 chatbots were selected based on predefined criteria from
both sources. These chatbots were systematically evaluated using a
comprehensive framework developed for this study, including chatbot
characteristics, user backgrounds, building relational capacity,
personalization, interaction models, responses to critical situations,
and user experiences. Ten coauthors were responsible for downloading and
testing the chatbots, coding their features, and evaluating their
performance in simulated conversations. The testing of all chatbot apps
was limited to their free-to-use features. Results: This review provides
an overview of the diversity of health-related chatbots, encompassing
categories such as mental health support, physical activity promotion,
and behavior change interventions. Chatbots use text, animations,
speech, images, and emojis for communication. The findings highlight
variations in conversational capabilities, including empathy, humor, and
personalization. Notably, concerns regarding safety, particularly in
addressing suicidal thoughts, were evident. Approximately 44\% (16/36)
of the chatbots effectively addressed suicidal thoughts. User
experiences and behavioral outcomes demonstrated the potential of
chatbots in health interventions, but evidence remains limited.
Conclusions: This scoping review underscores the significance of
chatbots in health-related applications and offers insights into their
features, functionalities, and user experiences. This study contributes
to advancing the understanding of chatbots' role in digital health
interventions, thus paving the way for more effective and user-centric
health promotion strategies. This study informs future research
directions, emphasizing the need for rigorous randomized control trials,
standardized evaluation metrics, and user-centered design to unlock the
full potential of chatbots in enhancing health and well-being. Future
research should focus on addressing limitations, exploring real-world
user experiences, and implementing robust data security and privacy
measures.","Xue, Jia and Zhang, Bolun and Zhao, Yaxi and Zhang, Qiaoru and Zheng,

WOS:000832007700001,"The Use of Artificial Intelligence-Based Conversational Agents
(Chatbots) for Weight Loss: Scoping Review and Practical Recommendations","Background: Overweight and obesity have now reached a state of a
pandemic despite the clinical and commercial programs available.
Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have a strong potential in
optimizing such programs for weight loss.
Objective: This study aimed to review AI chatbot use cases for weight
loss and to identify the essential components for prolonging user
engagement.
Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the 5-stage framework by
Arksey and O'Malley. Articles were searched across nine electronic
databases (ACM Digital Library, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, IEEE
Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) until July 9,
2021. Gray literature, reference lists, and Google Scholar were also
searched.
Results: A total of 23 studies with 2231 participants were included and
evaluated in this review. Most studies (8/23, 35\%) focused on using AI
chatbots to promote both a healthy diet and exercise, 13\% (3/23) of the
studies used AI chatbots solely for lifestyle data collection and
obesity risk assessment whereas only 4\% (1/23) of the studies focused
on promoting a combination of a healthy diet, exercise, and stress
management. In total, 48\% (11/23) of the studies used only text-based
AI chatbots, 52\% (12/23) operationalized AI chatbots through
smartphones, and 39\% (9/23) integrated data collected through fitness
wearables or Internet of Things appliances. The core functions of AI
chatbots were to provide personalized recommendations (20/23, 87\%),
motivational messages (18/23, 78\%), gamification (6/23, 26\%), and
emotional support (6/23, 26\%). Study participants who experienced
speech- and augmented reality based chatbot interactions in addition to
text based chatbot interactions reported higher user engagement because
of the convenience of hands-free interactions. Enabling conversations
through multiple platforms (eg, SMS text messaging, Slack, Telegram,
Signal, WhatsApp, or Facebook Messenger) and devices (eg, laptops,
Google Home, and Amazon Alexa) was reported to increase user engagement.
The human semblance of chatbots through verbal and nonverbal cues
improved user engagement through interactivity and empathy. Other
techniques used in text-based chatbots included personally and
culturally appropriate colloquial tones and content; emojis that emulate
human emotional expressions; positively framed words; citations of
credible information sources; personification; validation; and the
provision of real-time, fast, and reliable recommendations. Prevailing
issues included privacy; accountability; user burden; and
interoperability with other databases, third-party applications, social
media platforms, devices, and appliances.
Conclusions: AI chatbots should be designed to be human-like,
personalized, contextualized, immersive, and enjoyable to enhance user
experience, engagement, behavior change, and weight loss. These require
the integration of health metrics (eg, based on self-reports and
wearable trackers), personality and preferences (eg, based on goal
achievements), circumstantial behaviors (eg, trigger-based
overconsumption), and emotional states (eg, chatbot conversations and
wearable stress detectors) to deliver personalized and effective
recommendations for weight loss.","Chew, Han Shi Jocelyn",JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS,,2022,10.2196/32578,,webofscience.bib,2024-02-25 11:35:41,Unclassified

Review","Background: The personalization of conversational agents with natural
language user interfaces is seeing increasing use in health care
applications, shaping the content, structure, or purpose of the dialogue
between humans and conversational agents.
Objective: The goal of this systematic review was to understand the ways
in which personalization has been used with conversational agents in
health care and characterize the methods of its implementation.
Methods: We searched on PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and ACM
Digital Library using a predefined search strategy. The studies were
included if they: (1) were primary research studies that focused on
consumers, caregivers, or health care professionals; (2) involved a
conversational agent with an unconstrained natural language interface;
(3) tested the system with human subjects; and (4) implemented
personalization features.
Results: The search found 1958 publications. After abstract and
full-text screening, 13 studies were included in the review. Common
examples of personalized content included feedback, daily health
reports, alerts, warnings, and recommendations. The personalization
features were implemented without a theoretical framework of
customization and with limited evaluation of its impact. While
conversational agents with personalization features were reported to
improve user satisfaction, user engagement and dialogue quality, the
role of personalization in improving health outcomes was not assessed
directly.
Conclusions: Most of the studies in our review implemented the
personalization features without theoretical or evidence-based support
for them and did not leverage the recent developments in other domains
of personalization. Future research could incorporate personalization as
a distinct design factor with a more careful consideration of its impact
on health outcomes and its implications on patient safety, privacy, and

WOS:000696619000001,"Promoting Physical Activity Through Conversational Agents: Mixed Methods
Systematic Review","Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is crucial for well-being;
however, healthy habits are difficult to create and maintain.
Interventions delivered via conversational agents (eg, chatbots or
virtual agents) are a novel and potentially accessible way to promote
PA. Thus, it is important to understand the evolving landscape of
research that uses conversational agents.
Objective: This mixed methods systematic review aims to summarize the
usability and effectiveness of conversational agents in promoting PA,
describe common theories and intervention components used, and identify
areas for further development.
Methods: We conducted a mixed methods systematic review. We searched
seven electronic databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, ACM
Digital Library, Scopus, and Web of Science) for quantitative,
qualitative, and mixed methods studies that conveyed primary research on
automated conversational agents designed to increase PA. The studies
were independently screened, and their methodological quality was
assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool by 2 reviewers. Data on
intervention impact and effectiveness, treatment characteristics, and
challenges were extracted and analyzed using parallel-results convergent
synthesis and narrative summary.
Results: In total, 255 studies were identified, 7.8\% (20) of which met
our inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the studies was
varied. Overall, conversational agents had moderate usability and
feasibility. Those that were evaluated through randomized controlled
trials were found to be effective in promoting PA. Common challenges
facing interventions were repetitive program content, high attrition,
technical issues, and safety and privacy concerns.
Conclusions: Conversational agents hold promise for PA interventions.
However, there is a lack of rigorous research on long-term intervention
effectiveness and patient safety. Future interventions should be based
